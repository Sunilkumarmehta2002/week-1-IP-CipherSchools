“I’m feeling anxious, what can I do?




It’s important to discover what triggers your anxiety. Being aware of the cause can help you better manage your anxiety.

Anxiety is a mental health condition that can cause feelings of worry, fear, or tension. For some people,anxietycan also causepanic attacksand physical symptoms likechest pain.

Anxiety disordersare incredibly common. They affect an estimated40 million peoplein the United States, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America.

What causes anxiety and anxiety disorders can be complicated. It’s likely that a combination of factors, including genetics and environmental reasons, play a role.

However, it’s clear that some events, emotions, or experiences may causesymptoms of anxietyto begin or may make them worse. These elements are calledtriggers.

Anxiety triggers can be different for each person, but many triggers are common among people with these conditions. Most people find they have multiple triggers. But for some people, anxiety attacks can be triggered for no reason at all.

For that reason, it’s important to discover any anxiety triggers that you may have. Identifying your triggers is an important step in managing them.

Keep reading to learn about these anxiety triggers and what you can do to manage your anxiety.

A health diagnosis that’s upsetting or difficult, such ascanceror achronic illness, may trigger anxiety or make it worse. This type of trigger is very powerful because of the immediate and personal feelings it produces.

You can help reduce anxiety caused by health issues by being proactive and engaged with a doctor. Talking with a therapist may also be useful, as they can help you learn to manage your emotions around your diagnosis.

Certain prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications may trigger symptoms of anxiety. That’s because active ingredients in these medications may make you feel uneasy or unwell.

Those feelings can set off a series of events in your mind and body that may lead to additional symptoms of anxiety.

Medicatioons that may trigger anxiety include:

Talk with a doctor about how these drugs make you feel, and consider an alternative that doesn’t trigger your anxiety or worsen your symptoms.

Many people rely on their morning cup of joe to wake up, but it might actually trigger or worsen anxiety.

According to a2022 review, drinking about five cups of coffee increases anxiety and induces panic attacks in people withpanic disorder.

In a2020 Australian studyinvolving 429 20-year-old adults over a 2-year period, consuming energy drinks increased anxiety in males but not in females.

Work to cut back yourcaffeine intakeby substituting noncaffeinated options whenever possible.

When you don’t eat, your blood sugar may drop. That can lead to jittery hands and a rumbling tummy. It can also trigger anxiety.

Eatingbalanced mealsis important for many reasons. It provides you with energy and important nutrients. If you can’t make time for three meals a day, healthy snacks are a great way to prevent low blood sugar, feelings of nervousness or agitation, and anxiety.

Remember,food can affect your mood.

Your mind controls much of your body, and that’s certainly true with anxiety. When you’re upset or frustrated, thewords you say to yourselfcan trigger greater feelings of anxiety.

If you tend to use a lot of negative words when thinking about yourself, learning to refocus your language and feelings when you start down this path is helpful. Working with a therapist can be incredibly helpful with this process.

Worries about saving money or having debtcan trigger anxiety. Unexpected bills or money fears are triggers, too.

Learning to manage these types of triggers may require seeking professional help, such as from a financial advisor. Feeling you have a companion and a guide in the process may ease your concern.

If a room full of strangers doesn’t sound like fun,you’re not alone. Events that require you to make small talk or interact with people you don’t know can trigger feelings of anxiety, which may be diagnosed associal anxiety disorder.

To help ease your worries or unease, you can always bring along a companion when possible. But it’s also important to work with a professional to findcoping mechanismsthat make these events more manageable in the long term.

Relationship problems, arguments, disagreements — these conflicts can all trigger or worsen anxiety. If conflict particularly triggers you, you may need to learn conflict resolution strategies.

Also, talk with a therapist or other mental health expert to learn how to manage the feelings these conflicts cause.

Daily stressors like traffic jams or missing your train can cause anyone anxiety. But long-term or chronic stresscan lead tolong-term anxiety and worsening symptoms, as well as other health problems.

Stress can also lead to behaviors like skipping meals,drinking alcohol, ornot getting enough sleep. These factors can trigger or worsen anxiety, too.

Treating andpreventing stressoften requires learning coping mechanisms. A therapist or counselor can help you learn to recognize your sources of stress and handle them when they become overwhelming or problematic.

Public speaking, talking in front of your boss, performing in a competition, or even just reading aloud is a common trigger of anxiety. If your job or hobbies require this, your doctor or therapist can work with you to learn ways to be more comfortable in these settings.

Also, positive reinforcements from friends and colleagues can help you feel more comfortable and confident.

These triggers may be difficult to identify, but a mental health specialist is trained to help you identify them. These may begin with a smell, a place, or even a song. Personal triggers remind you, either consciously or unconsciously, of a bad memory or traumatic event in your life.

Individuals withpost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)frequently experience anxiety triggers from environmental triggers.

Identifying personal triggers may take time, but it’s important so you can learn to overcome them.

If you can identify and understand your triggers, you can work to avoid them and cope. You can learn specific coping strategies to handle the triggers when they happen.

Here are three tips for identifying triggers:

The most commonsymptoms of anxietyinclude:

If you experience these symptoms regularly for 6 months or more, you may havegeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD). Other types of anxiety disorders exist as well. The symptoms for those may be different than GAD.

For example, withpanic disorderyou may experience:

Although you may sometimes feel anxious for apparently no reason, there is usually an underlyingcause, and the trigger may be beyond your awareness.

If you constantly feel anxious without knowing why, this is a symptom ofgeneralized anxiety disorder.

In addition to the triggers listed above, the following are some of the possible reasons you may feel anxious for no reason:

If you’re feeling anxious but don’t know why, talking with a therapist may help determine what’s causing it.

If you believe you worry too much or suspect you have an anxiety disorder, it’s time to seek help. Recognizing anxiety is often difficult because the symptoms become common over time.

Start the discussion by talking with a doctor. They’ll discuss your symptoms, conduct a health history, and do a physical exam. They’ll want to rule out any possible physical problems that may be causing the issues, too.

From there, a doctor may choose to treat you with medication. They may also refer you to a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist. These doctors can use a combination of talk therapy and medication to treat anxiety and prevent triggers.

Occasional anxiety is common, but chronic feelings of worry, fear, or dread are not. They’re a sign you should seek professional help.

The good news is that anxiety is a highly treatable mental health condition. However,manypeople with anxiety don’t seek treatment.

If your anxiety is impeding your day-to-day life, you should consider seeking help. A mental health specialist can help you find a treatment plan that eases your symptoms, and they can help you cope with your anxiety triggers.

Transcript:
(00:00) today we have a pep talk episode because sometimes you just need inspiration and some mindset shifts to help you get to a place where you're feeling calmer more clear and less overwhelmed from the million things you have going on in your life and in your head for the person who is juggling a million different things worrying about the worst case scenario and being super hard on yourself because of it this is for you this is episode number 143 feeling anxious and overwhelmed this is for you welcome to calmly coping my name is tati
(00:35) Garcia and I'm a licensed therapist and Coach specializing in high functioning anxiety I help high Achievers overcome anxiety stress and overwhelm so they can feel calm balanced and confident from within thank you so much for tuning in so first I want to start off by saying anytime you are in a place of feeling anxious stressed or overwhelmed your emotional state is going to influence your perception and the way that you view things so the way that you feel so maybe you're feeling anxious or worried
(01:02) or maybe you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed or frustrated whatever emotional state you might be in especially if they are challenging emotions then that's going to color your perception so it's kind of the opposite of rose-colored glasses if you've ever heard that term before whereas with rose-colored glasses somebody is seeing things in like a very idealistic kind of way when you are feeling anxious and overwhelmed you you're typically going to see things in a very negative way so I share with my clients it's negative
(01:34) colored glasses even though that statement does not make sense but you know if we're going to take the opposite of the rose-colored glasses it's negative glasses essentially so you have kind of lenses over your eyes that are then filtering the things you're seeing around you and you're only focusing typically on the negative so this is going to result in you noticing more what could go wrong noticing more you know what you don't like about yourself or what you don't like about your current situation or any other number of
(02:06) negative things that you might be filtering out and noticing maybe you're focusing more on not having enough and what you need more of than what you already have in your life so maybe you're feeling like well I want a nicer house or I want a higher salary and you're kind of forgetting what it is that you already have where many times at one point that was exactly what you wanted and that goal post can tend to keep on moving but just noticing and having the awareness can be really powerful because that allows you to
(02:39) observe your thoughts and not identify with them and so because it's easy to get caught up in these negative ways of thinking and see these things as and these thoughts as facts when you can create some distance and realize okay I'm not feeling in the greatest mood that's probably affecting the way that I think and the way that I see things and so how can I become more aware of that so that I can realize that this perspective may not be an accurate representation of what's going on around me and so once you can recognize that
(03:10) and see that then you can notice that okay maybe things aren't as terrible as in making them out to be and my emotional state and my current mood is just making it seem that way and on the same note many times when we're in this kind of place it can feel like we're gonna be this way we're gonna feel this way forever it can feel as though there's no hope for things to improve or we can feel as though we have backslided backslid if we are on a personal development Journey we can feel as though you know if we're back in a place
(03:44) of feeling anxious and overwhelmed like oh I failed or I'm going backwards and I'm losing all of my progress when that is not the case the growth process is not linear and so it's going to be more of like ups and downs throughout time and gradually you're gonna see things improve but there's absolutely going to be moments where things are going to feel more difficult and many times in these moments where things are challenging and you're feeling overwhelmed and you're feeling anxious
(04:09) these are the perfect opportunities for learning and growth because this is where the change happens because this is where you can recognize that okay something isn't working for me whether it is the way that I'm thinking about things the way that I'm doing things or the way that I am interacting with the people around me whatever ever it might be this can be a signal for you that something needs to change and that can sometimes be a catalyst for things going differently in the future and many times
(04:39) I like to look at these moments of anxiety of stress of overwhelm as learning opportunities because then you can recognize okay this didn't work for me I was working way too many hours or I was really down on myself and and doubting myself and that really hurt my confidence and so now that I know that this didn't work what can I do differently next time and not coming from a place of judgment or shame not saying that well I could have done better or I should have done this differently or should have known better
(05:09) letting go of those shoulds and coulds and woods and just focusing on how can I use this as an opportunity for Learning and growth and that doesn't always come in the moment in fact many times it's difficult to have that perspective in the moment but this can just be something that comes after the fact and if you're able to tap into that perspective and see okay this is how I'm feeling now and it's not going to be this way forever and you know maybe I can Journal about how I'm feeling right
(05:35) now to tap more into what's coming up for me what my thoughts are so then I can reflect on this in the future when I'm in a place where maybe I'm feeling better and maybe I'm better able to look at the bigger picture because they say you know hindsight is 20 20 so that often allows you to reflect and make changes as needed and I want to remind you especially if you're feeling overwhelmed especially if you're feeling anxious and worrying about the worst case scenario a super valuable yet
(06:02) simple reminder can be to focus on what you can control because often when we're in a place of anxiety we're focusing on the things that we can't control we're focusing on the future we're focusing on uncertainty we're focusing on what could go wrong and the things that we can't predict or control and that leaves us into a place of feeling helpless it leaves us in a place where our minds can come up with a million different possibilities for what could happen and so that is just inevitably going to
(06:31) create more anxiety so when you can bring your focus back to okay let me focus on what I can control right now in this moment because that is the only thing we ever have control over that can help you to rein in some of that anxiety so rather than thinking like I want to say the perfect thing during this interview because I want to get this job or I want to give the most amazing presentation ever and you know blow everybody's socks off or knock everybody's socks off whatever the saying is focus on okay
(06:57) this meeting is coming up tomorrow I'm going to do what I can today to prepare give myself a cut off time and say you know at 6 PM I'm done with work relax so I can be fully prepared and rested and then focus on spending time with my loved ones or reading a book or doing my hobbies or watching my favorite shows or whatever it is so then I can be prepared for what is coming tomorrow because worrying does not prepare you any more for the thing that you're worried about it just makes you feel more anxious and
(07:25) more in a place of feeling helpless and frustrated and another important step is to take things one step at a time so many times especially if you resonate a lot of people really resonated with that episode that I did a few episodes back on hurry sickness I will link it in the corner if you're watching on YouTube so you can check that out but many times we can want to be a million steps ahead and that can add more overwhelm especially if you are mentally kind of putting yourself a million steps ahead when
(07:52) you're overwhelmed you can feel like I have so many things on my plate how am I ever gonna find time for this and many times there is not enough time for those things and so then you can want to be kind of planning ahead and anticipating well you know if I don't have enough time to do these things today then that's going to go into tomorrow and the next day and then my whole schedule is going to be thrown off and then what am I going to do and I'm not going to have enough time for myself and I'm not going
(08:16) to have enough time for the things that I enjoy doing et cetera et cetera et cetera so it can be really easy when you're in a place of overwhelm to feel like there's never enough time for the things that you have to do you need to get everything done right now because then once you get these things checked off then you'll be able to relax so if you're in this place I want to remind you to focus on taking one step at a time and if you're feeling particularly overwhelmed and frazzled it can really
(08:45) help to make a clear plan of what is it that you need to do and when are you going to do that and you don't have to plan out your entire month or week or anything like that you can take it one day at a time you can do it at a pace that feels comfortable for you so maybe if you find that you're staying up worrying about things or feeling overwhelmed or getting woken up in the middle of the night with all the things in your to-do list before bed or at the end of your work day maybe you can write down and make a plan okay these are all
(09:15) the things that are really stressing me and worrying me and causing me to feel overwhelmed right now so let me write these things down and then identify at least the beginning steps of a plan so that I can feel more control and Clarity over what's coming up and it's not going to eat into your relaxation time or your down time another reminder is to bring your awareness to your body and to your emotions and this can be by getting active so it can be by doing practices such as yoga going outside for a walk
(09:45) anything that's going to help you to be present and to be present in your physical body because thinking the anxiety the overwhelm happens up in our head and when you can bring that awareness down into your body then you're just naturally going to bring that attention away from worrying about all of these things and thinking about the next thing but you're going to bring your awareness back to the present so you can also do this through grounding exercises so one example that I like to share is what's called a 54321 grounding
(10:16) it's bringing your attention and awareness to your five senses so noticing what are five things that you can see what are four things that you can feel and really touching and noticing what do they feel like what are three things that you can hear two things that you can smell and one thing that you can taste and you can go through that exercise just as I described or you can just in any moment bring awareness to your five senses that brings you into your body and into your present moment experience and out of
(10:45) that place of feeling like you're completely out of control and you know one of the most important things that I'm sure many of you often don't take time for and you're not alone I I have absolutely been there so many of you say I struggle with taking time to relax or you know it's hard for me to take a break so starting in whatever way you can if it's really hard for you to say you know I want to relax for a few hours tonight or whatever it might be taking it in small chunks and doing it
(11:17) gradually so if you're feeling really overwhelmed now really anxious whatever is going on for you that is often a sign that you need this even more because the more disconnected we are from ourselves the less we're taking care of ourselves that's going to result in these emotional states of difficulty that are coming up for you and so sometimes it can feel more intense when you take a break because you're actually being confronted with your own thoughts and emotions and that can feel uncomfortable
(11:44) but many times that is what we need and so the further away we go from connecting with ourselves and listening to ourselves our bodies and our minds are going to scream louder and show up with coming up in other ways of all of this over overthinking or the anxiety under the surface or whatever that might look like for you so taking time to check in with yourself take care of yourself it's going to look different for everybody so I'm not going to prescribe anything specific but just encouraging you to do what you feel as
(12:13) though you need so for some people that's going to be taking a step back and resting and relaxing and doing something that is low energy like doing a meditation or writing in your journal or reading a book or watching your favorite show for other people that may be more active so maybe that is going for a walk or run or going to your local park or spending time with a friend or family member or whatever that looks like for you maybe it's also like doing a creative hobby or something else so tuning into what feels best for you in
(12:46) this moment and I just want to emphasize that reminder again that you will not feel this way forever and there are things that you can do to help you to feel better and at the same time just because you're feeling this way does it mean there's something wrong with you doesn't mean that you're a failure doesn't mean that you are backsliding or going backwards in your progress this is a natural part of being human and so the more that you can accept and acknowledge that it's okay to feel whatever way
(13:10) you're feeling then that is going to allow you to meet yourself exactly where you are and make a choice as to how you want to move forward rather than allowing the autopilot and the negative colored glasses to be skewing your perception and making those choices for you if you found this episode helpful I would love to hear your thoughts and before you go if you are catching this when this episode comes up I have an exciting live master class that I'm going to be hosting it's going to be taking place Tuesday March 14th at 2 pm

Transcript:
(00:01) [Music] hello my name is Tim box and I feel anxious I feel anxious about whether or not I'm gonna remember what I came here to say I feel anxious about whether or not you guys are going to agree with what I came here to say and if I'm completely honest up until about 30 seconds ago I felt a little bit anxious about the possibility of tripping up this rug on the way out but I think feeling anxious about these things while seemingly unhelpful is perhaps understandable after all it's important to me that I
(00:45) say exactly what I came here to say that my message gets heard and I achieved this without falling flat on my face yeah right now anxiety makes sense but there was a time in my life when I anxiety really didn't make sense I used to feel the kind of anxiety that meant I would struggle to even walk into a room with this many people in it let alone stand at the front and give a talk now obviously something has changed since then otherwise I wouldn't be standing here now and I think the main thing that's changed is that whilst I still
(01:19) experience anxiety I no longer suffer with it but I didn't achieve this shift by trying to get rid of it now don't get me wrong back in the day that's exactly what I was trying to do I would do all I could to avoid any anxiety inducing situation I would arrange my daily movements specifically avoiding social situations if I felt anxiety starting to flare up I'd run away I do all I could to retreat to safety and then employ various distraction techniques to take my mind away from the horribly
(01:50) uncomfortable feeling that something bad was about to happen it turns out that was my big mistake you see you don't get rid of anxiety by trying to get rid of it truth is you don't get rid of anxiety at all now by some twist of fate or perhaps as a direct result of what I went through back then I now work with anxiety sufferers to help them understand and ultimately overcome those feelings I spent a large part of the last ten years talking to anxiety sufferers about their anxiety and whilst all those I spoke to had
(02:27) their own individual story their own personal journey with anxiety every single one of them at some point expressed exactly the same desire that I used to have the desire to get rid of anxiety completely can you imagine if we all achieved that a world without anxiety what would they even look like well for example this room would probably look empty anxiety is the feeling that tells us when something is worth demanding our attention so in some small way it was anxiety that reminded you you had somewhere to be today
(03:04) without it none of us would have turned up and those that accidentally did will be watching an empty stage none of us would have businesses careers because we wouldn't have regarded studying gaining qualifications as worth bothering with and none of us would have boyfriends girlfriends husbands or wives either here or at home because we just wouldn't have seen the value of washing and dressing up to make a good impression on that all-important first date that we probably forgot to turn up to so it seems anxiety is important but of course
(03:39) there are those that don't feel anxiety there are two very distinct groups the first group dead people dead people don't feel anxious you know and I think that's okay they're dead they've got enough to not worry about the second group would be those we might refer to as Psychopaths those people that for whatever reason lack the ability to have any concern for the consequences of theirs or anyone else's actions now I don't know how you were brought up but when I was a kid I was given the distinct impression that
(04:15) being part of either of these two groups would be undesirable so if being free of anxiety would be such a bad idea why do we regard feeling anxious so negatively now I think the very obvious answer that question is that it feels horrible when we suffer high levels of anxiety over a long period of time it can very quickly start to dominate our life even go on to define our existence of course we're gonna try and get rid of it but what if we can't what if all of our attempts to control our anxiety response ultimately
(04:50) fail and where do we go I think most people go along to their local doctor and I should say at this point I'm a big fan of doctors they've saved my life on more than one occasion and I feel a tremendous amount of sympathy for them when it comes to treating anxiety issues because it's really not what they signed up for and it's certainly not what they're trained for when it comes to anxiety doctors are restricted in three important ways firstly time you get somewhere between 8 and 11 minutes for
(05:21) an appointment with your local GP which is nowhere near enough time to effectively diagnose and treat an anxiety issue secondly knowledge doctors are taught that anxiety is a mental health condition and yet they're not mental health specialists if a doctor wishes to become one of those they have to train for a further five or six more years to become a psychiatrist and thirdly resources doctors are given precious little support when it comes to actually treating anxiety I can put you on a 12 to 16 week waiting list for some
(05:54) form of counselling but by the time we got to the doctor we're probably in such desperate need of assistance that being told we now have to wait three or four months to talk to some is not helpful that leaves the only other option medication I'm not a fan of medicating anxiety now whilst I'm well aware that taking drugs can change the way we feel back in the 90s I witnessed many of my friends on a Saturday night discovering that very simple truth but with medication comes all sorts of unpredictable and unpleasant
(06:28) side-effects and in the unlikely event we do find the drug that agrees with you that calms your anxiety response without any side effects then of course it's all too easy to now regard ourselves as dependent on that drug and then the possibility of developing a dependency on our anti-anxiety medication just becomes something else to feel anxious about the truth is a medical solution to a non-medical problem will not solve that problem it will at best just patch over it for a short while now the irony here is that most of the people I've
(07:06) spoken to they already know all of this they know the doctor is not a great option for our anxiety which then begs the very obvious question so why do we go there I believe we go there because these days we are told anxiety is an illness and this is perhaps the one certain result of going to the doctor for your anxiety you will come away from there labelled with an anxiety issue maybe even diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and now you have a brand new thing to feel anxious about during the thousands of conversations I've had with
(07:43) anxiety sufferers there was a common thread when asked what they felt most anxious about the answer was generally how anxious they felt and if it would ever stop this concern is almost entirely created and fueled by the idea that anxiety is an illness anxiety is not an illness anxiety is an emotion every emotion is important every emotion has a purpose every emotion is a natural and vital part of our human experience in that respect anxiety is no more sinister than any other feeling we might have if we didn't feel anxiety would be one emotion
(08:28) short of the full set that really would be a disorder I want to share with you now an analogy that might go some way towards helping us understand our emotional responses I want you to think of your mind like a ship every ship has a captain and a crew in this analogy the captain is your logical rational conscious part of your thinking it's the part that knows where you want to go why you want to go there and has a fair idea of how you think you gonna get there unfortunately the part of our mind that has its hands and all the things that
(09:03) steer and sail our ship that's the crew that's your subconscious your subconscious is in charge of all of your automatic responses so your patterns of thought and behavior your belief systems and perhaps most importantly your emotions your crew sail your ship by triggering the appropriate emotional responses so for example if we regard something is dangerous our crew might trigger the feeling of fear we've become uncomfortable and this feeling will encourage us to move away from the danger to return to comfort if
(09:38) we believe we've been wronged a member of our crew might trigger anger will energize and our focus will be drawn towards taking whatever action is necessary to right the wrong so what about anxiety why do our crew trigger that particular emotion now no doubt every single one of us will have our own idea about what anxiety means to us but put simply anxiety is the emotion that tells us when something is too important to simply lose focus of it's the voice of concern about an upcoming event or situation that refuses to be ignored
(10:14) it's the crew saying to the captain you need to pay attention to this now here's the important part your crew are operating on one very simple principle they're trying to find the best strategy for the most happiness yes safety is important after all safety is a huge component part of happiness we can't feel happy if we don't feel safe but ultimately at all times your crew are trying to steer you in the direction of happiness as the American author Jon shed once wrote a ship in Harbor is safe
(10:46) but that is not what ships are built for so even when your crew are making you feel awful telling you things about yourself you really don't want to hear those seemingly self-destructive thoughts I'm not good enough I'll never succeed unlovable even these harsh words are simply designed to steer you away from any situation that might lead to an unhappy experience they're not trying to sink the ship they just tryna sail it away from the stormy seas that we fear we might not be able to cope with but every decision
(11:17) your crew makes is based upon the things you've learned throughout your life and because many of these things will learn when you were very young some of them no longer apply some of them were just wrong in the first place what this means is that as far as anxiety is concerned your crew will very often make mistakes but just because they get things wrong doesn't make them the enemy and yet this is a sentiment I hear all the time anxiety is the enemy people want to throw those crewmembers overboard and I
(11:55) can understand that after all if we regard a part of our mind as now actively trying to destroy us then of course it would be easy to view it as the enemy if we then believe our mind has actually turned against us it'll be easy to conclude our mind is broken it would be easy to believe that person that told us the way you feel means you are ill I started this talk by telling you I used to suffer debilitating levels of social anxiety so how did I get control of that what did I actually do to reduce it there are three main things
(12:31) I did that I think helped me change the first thing I did I refused to believe I was ill of all the things I felt anxious about I decided not to feel anxious about feeling anxious I recognize that every time I felt anxiety it wasn't random it was always triggered by a situation or a thought process once I understood this I could do the second thing that's to listen to my crew I spent too long pushing them away trying to ignore what they were telling me when you ignore someone with an important message
(13:05) they might just start to speak louder to get heard if you continue to ignore them they might start to shout the only way I was going to stop anxiety from shouting at me to listen to it to hear what it was saying to me I sought to understand what my crew were trying to achieve with these feelings and to turn my enemies into my friends and the funny thing is when you start listening listening to what your minds trying to tell you you can stop shouting when the crew stop shouting the captain can be heard that's the
(13:41) point where you're more logical thinking gets to have some info you get to decide is this feeling appropriate or inappropriate is it helpful or unhelpful once you have the ear of your crew and you know what you would want from them the third thing maybe the most important thing is to always always be kind to them if you're anything like me you spent a large part of your life beating yourself up over the things you did wrong or the things you didn't quite do right or just about the way you feel for
(14:15) all the criticism and negativity you've received from others throughout your life the person has given you the most it's probably you this has the cumulative effect of destroying morale aboard your ship a demoralized crew equals low self-esteem and low self-esteem means nail the slightest challenge will create anxiety but the good news is you can repair the damage that's been done very easily simply by deciding from now on to always talk to your crew to yourself with kindness and positivity people do their best work when they feel
(14:54) empowered to achieve your crew are no different put simply if you beat yourself up you just end up beating if you build yourself up who knows how far we can reach this is why I think it's okay maybe even important to feel anxiety every single day of our lives it means the crew are still sailing the ship and still trying to get it in the right direction it's a part of you that makes you reread the important email before you send it it's the part that makes sure you check your keys or in your pocket before you send the front
(15:28) door on your way out in the morning and it's the part that makes your heart skip a little bit when you think about giving that important presentation at work or in a theater truth is I still feel anxious all the time for example every Friday morning I wake feeling anxious because Friday is dustbin day my crew wake me with the thought I need to go and take the bins out now it's not debilitating anxiety it's barely a whisper it's just loud enough to get heard and then when I've taken the bins
(16:05) out it's gone and this might seem like a really trivial example but this is exactly the sort of thing that will trouble us if we believe the way we feel is not normal I wonder if back in the day when I'd suffered high levels of anxiety if I've been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder would I now dread Friday mornings would I feel anxious about the prospect of my anxiety flaring up again would I curse myself for still not being free of anxiety there tend to be too popular positions on high anxiety the first
(16:41) states it's a mental illness it's the way you're wired there's little we can do about it the second states is not real it's all in your head you just need to get over it neither of these positions are helpful and both are wrong the last 10 years have taught me the truth lies somewhere in the middle of course it's real we don't ask to feel this way and yet we do even though we feel this way now doesn't mean we can't change it the first step towards changing is to accept it once we accept anxiety as a natural
(17:16) part of our human experience and treat it not as our enemy but as a trusted friend you'll be surprised how quickly the crew just get back to sailing the ship and we start to feel a lot less anxious about anxiety so how do you feel today do you feel anxious about something good I mean you're alive it means as a part of you trying to tell you something that regards is important have a listen it's here to help my name is Tim box and now 18 minutes later I feel a lot less anxious thank you very much [Applause]



One Thing You Must Do to Overcome Anxiety | Sadhguru - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XCObQjSHIs

Transcript:
(00:00) Sadhguru: If your mind took instructions from you, would you create anxiety? Just do this simple sadhana, all of you. If you can't do any other yoga, this much you can do, isn't it? You will see, half your anxiety will start settling down because essentially the conflict is, there are two dimension within you.
(00:46) If your mind took instructions from you, would you create anxiety? No. So don't look for answers elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere, it is just that your own physiology and your psychological patterns are not taking instructions from you. So, you said so many things, "I try…" you know, whatever these big words are floating all over California particularly, about surrendering to it, about letting it go, about...
(01:16) Not for one person has such a thing worked – ever. (Laughter) Has it, I'm asking you? You have anxiety – try to let it go. (Laughter) Does it go? Even a flu, damn flu, doesn't go! (Laughter) Yes, or no? Participants: Yes. Sadhguru: Even a simple cold does not go; you say, "Go!" Does it go? (Laughter) So, let's not get into this fanciful states of surrendering, these are all words thrown around.
(01:49) Nobody knows what is surrender, because when it happens, you will not know it has happened. (Laughs) You can't do it, "I surrendered!" How is that possible? (Laughter) So, leaving those things, essentially, as I said, you have not read the user's manual, of how this works.
(02:15)  (Referring to oneself) We need to pay attention to this. (Referring to oneself) The system is made in such a way, if you hold your hand like this (Gestures) it'll work one way; if you do like this, it'll work another way; if you do like that, it'll work another way – it's a phenomenal process! If it was a simple thing, we could have just beaten it into shape with hammer and anvil, okay? It's too sophisticated, it's a phenomenally complex machine.
(02:40) One needs to pay a certain level of attention to be able to use it for what it is designed for, otherwise it'll get itself messed up. Now, there may be many factors, there may be genetic factors, there may be sociological factors, there may be growing up issues, you know, various things, but do not ascribe your problems to any of those things.
(03:04) The important thing is just this: you are not able to have your mind the way you want it, that's the only problem you have, isn't it? The moment you ascribe it, "I am like this because my father was like that, I am like this because my grandfather's genetics were not okay" – you're finished! (Laughter) Because we can't change those guys now.
(03:30)  (Laughter) Yes? You can't choose a different father, or a different grandfather now, it's over! (Laughter) But you can transform this. (Referring to oneself) You must understand, still it doesn't matter you have anxiety disorder, still if you put a piece of carrot, there is an intelligence here which can transform a carrot into a human being.
(03:51) That means, every day a new body is being manufactured within you, isn't it? In parts, a new human being is manufactured every day. When the very source of creation is functioning within you, and a new human being is constantly being created, if you take little charge of that, you can create an entire new physiological and psychological process.
(04:18) This happened to us some time ago. Last year, we were trekking in Tibet. I was in a tent, I was doing some work, and... another person was cutting an apple. You know, one of these porcelain knives these days? So, the other person around says to this person, "It's a very sharp knife, be careful.
(04:46) " It irritates me a bit; I look like this (Gestures) because he's a grown man. If it's a child it's different, then we have to watch how he uses the knife; it's a full-grown man, and a knife is supposed to be sharp. (Laughter) If it's not sharp, why do you call it a knife? (Laughter) So, I ignored it, and continued to work; another two minutes, she says again, "It's a very sharp knife, be careful.
(05:18) " (Laughter) I said, "Come on! He's a full-grown man, leave him alone, he knows how to use this knife! This stupid knife, can't he handle? It's not some earth-moving machinery, or spacecraft or something that he doesn't know how to handle – it's a knife!" She says, "No, Sadhguru, it's a very sharp knife.
(05:42) " (Laughter) What?! As I continue what I'm doing, in another two minutes, she whispers to him, "Please be careful, very sharp." (Laughter) And in another two minutes, he cuts his finger. (Laughter) Then I give up, okay? This is all that's happening, this is all that's happening with life. You have an intellect for which you don't have a stable enough platform.
(06:10) Or, in other words, you have a sharp knife, I'm sorry – a very sharp knife – (Laughter) a very sharp knife in your hand, but your hand is not steady. (Gestures) Please see, it's your own mind which is causing all this pain, isn't it? Yes, or no? So, you have a very sharp knife; the sharper it is, the more you cut yourself.
(06:38) So, we don't have to blunt the knife, we just have to have a steady hand, isn't it? Nothing has been done about that. People are trying to blunt the knife with all these sedatives and nonsense – what you take is to blunt the knife. Blunting the knife is not the answer, because if you lower the possibilities of who you are, everything will be okay.
(07:02) If we remove half of your brain, you'll be quite peaceful (Laughter) because it takes some brain to cause anxiety. (Laughter) If we really remove half of your brain, you'll be quite peaceful, and you may even be happy, actually. (Laughter) Nothing bothers you, you're okay, all right? (Laughter) But that's not what we're looking for.
(07:28) What a human being is looking for is to become limitless in some way, and if this has to happen, you have to create a steady platform. Knife need not be taken away, knife need not be blunted, only thing is, hand needs to be steadied, isn't it? No process to be done. (Applause) What... what Inner Engineering means, what yoga means is just this.
(07:57) When I say yoga, being in California, don't imagine all those impossible postures. (Laughter) Yoga does not mean postures, yoga means union, okay? The word 'yoga' literally means union. This is the first form of union, hmm? (Gestures namaskar) Your right and left, this is called as pingala and ida in yoga – the masculine and the feminine within you.
(08:23) Just put it together, just do this simple sadhana, all of you. If you can't do any other yoga, this much you can do, isn't it? What you do is, something that concerns your life – it could be the sun coming up. Sun is coming up; without sun coming up, you wouldn't exist on this planet, isn't it? The warmth of life is going on within you only because the sun comes up.
(08:46) Without the tree exhaling oxygen, and you exhaling carbon dioxide for it, and this exchange happening, you wouldn't be alive, isn't it? Like this look at it, the food that you eat, the sun, the earth that you walk upon, air that you breathe, water that you drink, people who live around you, whatever, you choose anyone, just do this.
(09:06)  (Gestures) Put your right and left together perfectly; not like this, not like this – perfectly, okay? Just look at something that really matters to you, maybe the sun, maybe the sky, maybe the cloud, maybe a tree, maybe a person, maybe a child, an animal, it doesn't matter what – just look at it, putting your hands together for 10, 12 minutes at a stretch.
(09:30) You will see, half your anxiety will start settling down, because essentially the conflict is, there are two dimensions within you; for… I don't want to go into an elaborate description of this, because the yogic physiology goes elaborately into this, but to put it simply, even modern medical science is telling you there's a right brain and a left brain, all right? Just put these two things together, look at with utmost love and appreciation towards something that matters to you – it could be your wife, it could be your husband,
(10:07) it could be your child, a tree, a dog, sky, sun, moon, whatever, every one of them are vital for your life, isn't it so? Yes? Whatever you can relate to, putting these two things together, just look at them with utmost pleasantness that you can generate, recognizing how important they are for you – many things will change.
(10:31) This is first form of yoga. If I do this, it'll become difficult.(Gestures) And there are many ways to do namaskar: like this, like that, like that. (Gestures) This is the most simple thing. (Gestures) Start here, okay? (Laughs)

Why is stress management so important?

4 ways to deal with stress at home

4 stress management techniques for work

4 stress management techniques for relationships

4 ways to deal with stress quickly

4 long-term stress management techniques

What not to do when managing stress

When should you see a doctor?

Managing stress isn’t a one-size-fits-all system. Depending on the type and regularity of your stress, your stress management regiment will look vastly different from another individual’s. But it’s helpful to have a toolkit of stress management techniques on hand should you need them.

If you need to know how to relax fast and reduce stress, you’ve come to the right place. We’ve rounded up a comprehensive list of 20 stress management techniques.

They will help you:

Before we jump in, let’s first take a beat to recognize that ourstress levels are at an all-time high.

According to the American Psychological Association (APA),67% of Americans report feeling increased stresssince the COVID-19 outbreak began.

And 78% say the pandemic is a significant source of stress in their life. And this stress is on top of the daily stressors we already experienced before. Stressors such as work, health, finances, family, and relationships.

A little bit of stress can be healthy. But chronic stress, as we’re seeing, can negatively affect your mental health and physical well-being.

The scope of the stress problem is another part of the reason managing stress effectively is so significant.

It’s normal to face stressful situations in life. Everyday stressors include everything from the daily commute to paying your taxes.

Stress affects everyone. The important thing is to learn to manage it so that our stress levels don’t become overwhelming.

Symptoms of stress

You may experience one or two of the above symptoms while your friend is grappling with five of them. Both responses are entirely normal but require different stress management techniques.

Learning to manage stress effectively is crucial for yourlong-term health and well-being. Here are four of the main benefits of using stress management techniques:

You probably already know that excessive stress is associated with poor physical andmental fitness.

One study even found thatstress can be as bad for you as smoking five cigarettesper day. Let’s take a closer look at three of the main risks associated with stress.

Burnout is a result of prolonged stress. According to Gallup, 8 out of 10 employeesexperience burnout at least some of the time.

But while we tend to associate burnout with work, it can also be caused by other extended stressful situations, such as caring for an elderly parent.

According to the American Heart Association,stress can have serious long-term health consequences.

When your stress response activates, your heart rate is higher than normal. This increase is not a problem if it only lasts a short time. But when stress dominates your everyday life, it can put pressure on your heart.

Being in astate of fight or flightreduces your body’s capacity to function properly. It detracts vital energy from processes and systems, such as the digestive and reproductive systems.

It can also affect your endocrine system, which is responsible for your hormonal health. This can create imbalances in your body that lead to health problems and disease.

Home should be a sanctuary. But they can actually be one of the most significant sources of stress in our lives.

For example, you might struggle with a relationship with a family member or neighbor, financial problems, or your daily routine.

Here are four ways to reduce stress at home:

If you feel that someone in your home is mistreating you,speak up for yourself. Let them know how their behavior is affecting you. Communicating the problem will help you find a solution and reduce your stress.

If you are stressed about a problem, the best strategy is to look for a way to solve it.

This solution will reduce the stress the problem is causing you.Humans love to problem-solve, so it will also give you a sense of satisfaction.

If your outer world is chaotic, it can create disorder in your mind and make you feel more stressed.

Having a clean and tidy home helps maintain mental balance and reduce stress by giving us a sense of control over our lives.

If possible, find a space in your home where you can be alone and dedicate time to yourself. It doesn’t need to be big, but it should be somewhere that others won’t disturb you.

For many people, work can become a top stressor in their lives.

In fact,workers’ daily stress levels reached a record high in 2020.

And because it can affect your work performance and other areas of your life, reducing stress at work is more important than ever. You can use these four stress management techniques at work:

Knowing your job expectations is fundamentalfor fulfilling your role at work.

Being unsure of the requirements can cause stress. Ask for clarification from your supervisor whenever you need it.

Multitasking reduces your effectiveness at work. Not only that, but it makes us feel more stressed and more likely to drop the ball on something.

Doing one task at a time is less stressful and will help you achieve better results.

Workplace conflict can be a major source of stress.Minimize potential conflictsby avoiding controversial topics such as politics, religion, or gossip.

The discomfort caused by inadequate chairs or desks, annoying noises, and even clothing can make you feel stressed.

Adjust your work environment and clothing to make sure you’re as comfortable as possible.

Interpersonal relationships are complicated and can be a huge source of stress. Let’s take a look at four ways to deal with stressful relationships:

High levels of stress in one or both partners can affect their ability to communicate effectively and manage conflict. If left unaddressed, this often causes stress in the relationship.

Try to remove external stressors if possible. If not, look for ways to manage stress individually to avoid impacting the relationship.

When there is a problem in one aspect of a relationship, it can spread to other areas and become a source of stress. It’s essential to talk to each other to get to the heart of the issue and work to resolve it.

It can be hard to find time for yourself in a close relationship, which can cause you to feel suffocated and stressed. It’s essential to dedicate quality time to yourself and the things you enjoy.

Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings, arguments, and stress.

Learning to communicate effectively and constructivelycan reduce conflicts and stress.

Sometimes you need to find a way to reduce your stress levels quickly. Keep these four stress management techniques in your back pocket for the next time you face a stressful situation:

Exercise of any kind can be an effective stress reliever.

Taking a short walk has the advantage of removing you from the source of your stress — whether that’s a demanding boss, an argument with your partner, or a problem you can’t seem to solve.

This simple act allows you to clear your head, calm down, and approach the situation from a different perspective.

Taking a few deep breathscan help instantly relieve stress. Make sure you breathe into your belly as shallow breathing signals to the body that the stress response is still required.

You might find it helpful to learn some breathing exercises from an experienced teacher. Keep these exercises on hand and use them whenever you feel stressed.

Research suggests that certain scents — such as those found in essential oils —can decrease the levels of stress hormones in our bodies.

Whether you prefer a scented candle, a diffuser, or fresh flowers, try using scent to calm you when you feel stressed.

Hugging is a surprisingly effective way to combat stress. It releases oxytocin, which is the “love hormone” that’s responsible for bonding.

It also reduces blood pressure and the stress hormone norepinephrine. This hormone activates the relaxation response, helping to quickly calm you.

Prevention is better than the cure, and stress is no exception. Use these preventive strategies to reduce long-term stress.

Physical activity is a powerful short-term stress reliever. It releases endorphins, the feel-good hormones that give us natural stress relief.

But in the long-term, exercise also helps combat the physical effects of stress. Exercise keeps your heart healthy and improves your overall levels of wellness.

Whether it’s running, yoga, or Tai Chi, the key to maintaining a regular exercise routine is to find something you enjoy doing.

Eating a poor diet can aggravate your stress response. Stress can cause us to reach for highly addictive, highly processed foods loaded with salt, sugar, and fats.

But these foods cause your blood sugar to spike. This releases more cortisol, the stress hormone, making you feel more anxious and stressed.

Eating abalanced diet has a variety of health benefits, including mitigating the effects of stress.

Mindfulness practices such as meditation are proven to be effective stress management techniques.

Practicing gratitude is another effective techniquefor managing stress long-term. It helps you transform negative thoughts into positive ones.

Relaxation techniques such as guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation can lower stress.

These techniques activate the parasympathetic nervous system. This is the part of your nervous system responsible for the relaxation response.

When trying to manage stress, you may take some wrong turns. Here are four things you shouldavoid doingwhen trying to manage stress:

Manage your environment by avoiding people and situations that cause you to stress as best that you can. For example, if you work from home, make sure you have a quiet place to work where the people around you don’t disturb you.

Time managementis an essential skill for dealing with stress.Time blockingcan help you meet deadlines more efficiently and show up for meetings on time. Make sure you allow for unforeseen roadblocks.

When dealing with stress, make time for a dailyself-care routinethat supports your physical andmental fitness.

Additionally, you may need more time to yourself. In that case, try establishing healthy boundaries to maintain a work-life balance.

A big part of successfully dealing with stressors is believing that you can overcome them. This positive mindset shift is essential for lowering your stress levels.

If you feel overwhelmed, try to reframe the issue. For example, instead of thinking of your to-do list as things you “have” to do, reframe it as things you “get” to do.

Consider adopting a mantra such as “I can handle this,” and repeat it to yourself daily. A mantra such as this can help boost your self-esteem as you overcome your stressors and build confidence in your strength.

Stress affects different people in different ways. Consider speaking to a health professional if you notice:

Stress management techniques can help you improve every area of your life — from your health to your work to your relationships.

Over time, daily acts of self-care can lead to reduced stress, improved sleep, and better overall health and well-being. So try some of these stress-management techniques to find balance and reduce stress in your day-to-day.

Clinical psychologistAdam Borland, PsyD, explains how stress works and healthy ways we can help manage stress before it gets out of control.

Stress is your body’s response to a challenge or demand. Everyone experiences stress, which can be triggered by a range of events, from small daily hassles to major changes like adivorceor job loss. The stress response includes physical components like an elevated heart rate and blood pressure, thoughts and personal beliefs about the stressful event, and emotions, including fear and anger.

“Although we often think of it as being negative, stress can also come from positive changes in your life, like getting a promotion at work or having a new baby,” says Dr. Borland.

Stress serves an important purpose — it enables us to respond quickly to threats and avoid danger. But lengthy exposure to stress may lead to mental health difficulties likeanxietyanddepression, or increasedphysical health problems.

“A large body of research suggests that increased stress levels interfere with your ability to deal with physical illness,” says Dr. Borland. “While no one can avoid all stress, you can work tohandle it in healthy waysthat increase your potential to recover.”

Some people try to reduce stress by drinking alcohol or eating too much. These actions may seem to help in the moment, but actually may add to stress in the long run. Caffeine also can compound the effects of stress. While consuming a healthy, balanced diet can help combat stress.

In addition to having physical health benefits, exercise has been shown to be a powerful stress reliever. Consider noncompetitive aerobic exercise, strengthening with weights or movement activities likeyogaorTai Chi, and set reasonable goals for yourself.Aerobic exercisehas been shown to release endorphins — natural substances that help you feel better and maintain a positive attitude.

People who use nicotine often refer to it as a stress reliever. However, nicotine actually places more stress on your body by increasing physical arousal and reducing blood flow and breathing. Plus, it canworsen chronic pain, so if you’re experiencing prolonged tension and body aches, smoking won’t help.

Taking the time to relax every day helps manage stress and protect your body from the effects of stress. You can choose from a variety of techniques, such asdeep breathing,guided imagery,progressive muscle relaxation, andmindfulness meditation. Many online and smartphone apps provide guidance on these techniques. Although some require purchase costs, many are available free of charge.

If you’re like most people, your life may be filled with too many demands and too little time. For the most part, these demands are ones we’ve chosen. But you can free up time by practicing time-management skills like asking for help when it’s appropriate, setting priorities, pacing yourself and reserving time to take care of yourself.

The more your actions reflect your beliefs, the better you’ll feel, no matter how busy your life is. Use your values when choosing your activities.

“Considering the stressful demands and responsibilities we face on a daily basis, it’s important to engage in activities that are in line with our values and speak to us on a personal level,” encourages Dr. Borland.

It’s OK to say “no” to demands on your time and energy that’ll place too much stress on you. You don’t always have to meet the expectations of others.

It’s also OK — and healthy — to realize you can’t be 100% successful at everything all at once. Be mindful of the things you can control and work on accepting the things that you can’t control.

When you’re feeling overwhelmed, remind yourself of what you do well. There are ways you canbuild a healthy sense of self-esteem.

Thisbehavioral techniquehelps you learn stress reduction skills by providing information about muscle tension, heart rate and other vital signs as you attempt to relax. It’s used to gain control over certain bodily functions that cause tension and physical pain. Biofeedback can be used to help you learn how your body responds in stressful situations, and how to cope better. If a headache, such as a migraine, begins slowly, many people can use biofeedback to stop the attack before it becomes full-blown.

Transcript:
(00:00) as a pre-med or medical student I'm sure you're more than familiar with stress whether it's finances academic strain or pressure from family friends and peers you're not alone here's how to deal with stress as a student dr. jabal medical insiders calm as described by the yerkes-dodson law mild amounts of physiological or mental stress actually improve performance but only up to a point further increases in stress prove detrimental not only in immediate short-term performance but chronic stress can lead to a variety of
(00:31) physical and mental health issues as well ever since getting diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease as a freshman in college I began taking stress mitigation measures much more seriously many autoimmune conditions including Crohn's disease are exacerbated by unmanaged stress these are the lessons I've learned over the years while stress can be varied including physical stressors like intense training or an illness we'll be focusing on mental stressors that students face in day-to-day life academic stress is
(00:59) likely what you're most familiar with this includes needing to learn and memorize large quantities of information meet deadlines with projects or assignments and of course the stress of upcoming exams and maintaining good grades social stress includes peer pressure the stress of new relationships whether platonic or romantic balancing your academics with social life and adjusting to your new environment after all you may not yet be fully adjusted to living on your own without your family stress of daily life includes other
(01:26) factors like financial burdens your daily commute or balancing a part-time job I don't believe there's a single best way to manage stress in all situations there are a few foundations to focus on and then a few targeted techniques depending on the specifics of the stressor let's start with the foundations on a foundational level you want to begin by focusing on organization if you're enrolled in four classes each of which has various assignments and test dates it can quickly become overwhelming by simply
(01:54) taking the time to get organized such as putting class times in your calendar including exam times and assignment due dates you'll greatly reduce the sense of dread chaos and uncertainty you feel when approaching your academics organization extends to other aspects of your life - like time management rather than approaching each day as a blank slate and and doing what you feel like when you feel like try time blocking during those hours when you know you'll be more focused and more productive plan on
(02:21) setting aside a few hours for more intense and focused work or studying during the hours when you know focusing will be difficult block out time to get a workout in or do laundry or grab groceries staying organized in this way will also warn off procrastination one of the most common and insidious stressors amongst students and it mitigates the issues of balancing social stressors with academic stressors if you know when to study and when to hang out with friends you won't have to make the decision each time a social opportunity
(02:50) presents itself in college I was definitely more of a night owl for that reason I would roll out of bed around 8:00 or 9:00 a.m. go to lecture and after classes my brain would feel cooked so I'd workout in the afternoon then go home and eat after cleaning up my dishes this was the time I felt I could most effectively focus and get work done in medical school I became more of an early riser and my schedule flipped my best and focused work was in the mornings and I stopped studying in the evenings don't
(03:17) be afraid to experiment and try a new schedule out for a few days to see how it feels transitioning from night owl to early bird is common as one ages on a foundational level you should also know that exercise is a phenomenal way to let off steam rather than bottling it up inside you loneliness is also an insidious factor that can exacerbate stress maintaining healthy social support and connections with friends is beneficial so long as you don't overdo it and neglect other academic and personal responsibilities
(03:45) as for the targeted strategies my recommendations depend on the magnitude of the stressor and whether or not you feel the situation is manageable when feeling overwhelmed or out of control two things have proven most useful to me first slow deep breathing and second mindful observation the deep breathing helps to activate the parasympathetic nervous system which is responsible for rest and digest functions this counteracts the overactive sympathetic nervous system responsible for the fight-or-flight response that gets activated in
(04:16) stressful situations I've learned the power of mindfulness when I was battling my first acute flare of inflammatory bowel disease at 18 the pain was intense and excruciating and I didn't know how to manage it I tried distracting myself by playing Tetris thinking that would occupy my mind but it didn't do much I was constantly fearful of the next bout of pain but a subtle mental shift made it completely manageable rather than rejecting the pain and wanting to run away and avoid it I just watched it I
(04:44) noticed where it occurred how it felt and what made it better or worse rather than approaching it with fear I approached it with curiosity by accepting that the pain was here and simply watching it the emotional hold had had on me vanished it still wasn't pleasant but my stress during the pain decreased and the stress between bouts of pain had disappeared you can use this same technique of mindful observation any other time you feel overwhelmed the next time you feel stressed observe the bodily response do you feel tightness in
(05:14) your abdomen is your heart racing by watching with curiosity you may also find it easier to separate yourself from the emotional hold of the stressful situation and my experience the situation becomes instantly more manageable whenever I sat down for a test I always did better than what my practice questions would indicate how it all comes down to self-talk when approached by a stressful situation what dialogue occurs in your head when it came to taking a test I could feel that the pressure was on silence across the
(05:44) room other than the shuffle of papers no eye contact or interaction between students the environment just felt higher intensity and my body responded accordingly that mild physiologic sympathetic response I felt was one of two things either fear or excitement and I could decide how to give it significance I would approach each test with almost an adversarial relationship it was me versus the test and with the elevated stakes my focus was improved I was excited about it in my head the dialogue was bring it each time I worked
(06:16) through a difficult problem and I felt confident about my answer it further bolstered my confidence that I was going to dominate this test and when I inevitably came across a more difficult question I acknowledged it was a good try to stop me but I'd come back before the end of the test and get it right I understand the sounds of ridiculous and way out there but this worked for me in fact I'll admit I even enjoyed taking tests sure studying had its moments of drudgery and boredom and I had to push through but taking the test was like
(06:46) playing the sports game it was show time in more extreme situations where I felt out of control or overwhelmed I found deep breathing and mindful observation to be the most effective with grounding me adjusting my self-talk was most effective only when I was at a more moderate or mild stress level deep breathing and mindfulness made chaos feel manageable and self-talk made the situation become fun whether it was a test or another stressor my self-talk focused on the opportunity to be challenged to do my best work and to
(07:16) prove to myself that I could do more than I expected the last targeted strategy is to break down a seemingly large or overwhelming situation into more manageable steps rather than focusing on the idea of having to cycle 100 miles for my first century which was incredibly intimidating at the beginning of the ride I just focused on writing one more mile and then another mile after that or let's say you're taking on a big new project at school or you want to start your first side hustle don't look at the
(07:45) final goal then see where you're at and feel defeated instead ask yourself what is one step I can take today that will bring me closer to that goal and what about the day after that as they say we often overestimate what we can accomplish in a day but underestimate what we can accomplish in a year some of the stuff may seem out there but I hope you find something useful since procrastination is such a common problem we all face and a huge cause of stress you may enjoy watching my video on seven steps to cure procrastination and if
(08:14) you're dealing with feeling like a failure or letting yourself down I have a video on that too thanks for watching much love and I'll see you guys in that next one [Music] [Music]

Depression can be temporary or long-term. You may find help with mediation or different therapies, such as cognitive behavior therapy. It’s important to seek professional help if you’re feeling major depression.

If you think someone is considering suicide, get help from a crisis or suicide prevention hotline. Try the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988.

Depression is classified as a mood disorder. It may be described as feelings of sadness, loss, or anger that interfere with a person’s everyday activities.

It’s also fairly common. Data from theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionestimates that 18.5 percent of American adults had symptoms of depression in any given 2-week period in 2019.

Though depression and grief share some features, depression isdifferent from grieffelt after losing a loved one or sadness felt after a traumatic life event. Depression usually involves self-loathing or a loss of self-esteem, while grief typically does not.

In grief, positive emotions and happy memories of the deceased typically accompany feelings of emotional pain. In major depressive disorder, the feelings of sadness are constant.

People experience depression in different ways. It may interfere with your daily work, resulting in lost time and lower productivity. It can also influence relationships and some chronic health conditions.

Conditions that can get worse due to depression include:

It’s important to realize that feeling down at times is a normal part of life. Sad and upsetting events happen to everyone. But if you’re feeling down or hopeless on a regular basis, you could be dealing with depression.

Depression is considered a serious medical condition that can get worse without proper treatment.

Depression can be more than a constant state of sadness or feeling “blue.”

Major depression can cause a variety of symptoms. Some affect your mood and others affect your body. Symptoms may also be ongoing or come and go.

Not everyone with depression will experience the same symptoms. Symptoms can vary in severity, how often they happen, and how long they last.

If you experience some of the following signs andsymptomsof depression nearly every day for at least 2 weeks, you may be living with depression:

The symptoms of depressioncan be experienced differentlyamong males, females,teens, andchildren.

Males may experience symptoms related to their:

Females may experience symptoms related to their:

Children may experiencesymptomsrelated to their:

There are several possible causes of depression. They can range from biological to circumstantial.

Common causesinclude:

Risk factors for depressioncan be biochemical, medical, social, genetic, or circumstantial. Common risk factors include:

The causes of depression are often tied to other elements of your health.

You may successfully manage symptoms with one form of treatment, or you may find that a combination of treatments works best.

It’s common to combine medical treatments and lifestyle therapies, including the following:

Your healthcare professional may prescribe:

SSRIsare themost commonlyprescribed antidepressant medications and tend to have few side effects. They treat depression by increasing the availability of the neurotransmitterserotoninin your brain.

SSRIs shouldnot be takenwith certain drugs includingmonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)and in some cases thioridazine or Orap (pimozide).

People who are pregnant should talk to their healthcare professionals about the risks of taking SSRIs during pregnancy. You should alsouse cautionif you have narrow-angle glaucoma.

Examples of SSRIs includecitalopram (Celexa),escitalopram (Lexapro),fluvoxamine(Luvox),paroxetine(Paxil, Paxil XR, Pexeva), andsertraline(Zoloft).

SNRIstreat depression by increasing the amount of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine in your brain.

SNRIs should not be taken with MAOIs. You should use caution if you have liver or kidney problems, or narrow-angleglaucoma.

Examples of SNRIs includedesvenlafaxine(Pristiq, Khedezla),duloxetine(Cymbalta, Irenka), levomilnacipran (Fetzima), andvenlafaxine(Effexor XR).

Tricyclic antidepressants(TCAs) and tetracyclic antidepressants (TECAs) treat depression by increasing the amount of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine in your brain.

TCAscan causemore side effects than SSRIs or SNRIs. Do not take TCAs or TECAs with MAOIs. Use with caution if you have narrow-angle glaucoma.

Examples of tricyclic antidepressants includeamitriptyline(Elavil),doxepin(Sinequan),imipramine(Tofranil), trimipramine (Surmontil),desipramine(Norpramin),nortriptyline(Pamelor, Aventyl), and protriptyline (Vivactil).

These drugscan treatdepression by increasing the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline in your brain.

Examples of NDRIs includebupropion (Wellbutrin).

MAOIs treat depression byincreasing the levelsof norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and tyramine in your brain.

Due to side effects andsafety concerns, MAOIs are not the first choice for treating mental health disorders. They are typically used only if other medications are unsuccessful at treating depression.

Examples of MAOIs include isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Emsam), tranylcypromine (Parnate).

N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagoniststreat depressionby increasing levels of glutamate in the brain. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter believed to be involved in depression.

NMDA antagonists are used only in patients who have not had success with other antidepressant treatments.

The FDA has approved one NMDA medication,esketamine(Spravato), for the treatment of depression.

Esketamine is a nasal spray that is only available through a restricted program called Spravato REMS.

Patients may experience tiredness and dissociation (difficulty with attention, judgment, and thinking) after taking the medication. For this reason, esketamine is administered in a healthcare setting where a healthcare professional can monitor for sedation and dissociation.

Each type of medication that’s used to treat depression has benefits and potential risks.

Speaking with a therapistcan help you learn skills to cope with negative feelings. You may also benefit from family or group therapy sessions.

Psychotherapy, also known as “talk therapy,” is when a person speaks to a trained therapist to identify and learn to cope with the factors that contribute to their mental health condition, such as depression.

Psychotherapy hasbeen shownto be an effective treatment in improving symptoms in people with depression and other psychiatric disorders.

Psychotherapy is often used alongside pharmaceutical treatment. There are many different types of psychotherapy, and some people respond better to one type than another.

Incognitive behavioral therapy(CBT), a therapist will work with you to uncover unhealthy patterns of thought and identify how they may be causing harmful behaviors, reactions, and beliefs about yourself.

Your therapistmightassign you “homework” where you practice replacing negative thoughts with more positive thoughts.

Dialectical behavior therapy(DBT) is similar to CBT, but puts a specific emphasis on validation, or accepting uncomfortable thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, instead of fighting them.

Thetheoryis that by coming to terms with your harmful thoughts or emotions, you can accept that change is possible and make a recovery plan.

Psychodynamic therapyis a form of talk therapy designed to help you better understand and cope with your day-to-day life. Psychodynamic therapy isbased on the ideathat your present-day reality is shaped by your unconscious, childhood experiences.

In this form of therapy, your therapist will help you reflect and examine your childhood and experiences to help you understand and cope with your life.

Exposure to doses of white lightcan help regulate your mood and improve symptoms of depression. Light therapy is commonly used inseasonal affective disorder, which is now called major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern.

Talk with a health professional before using light therapy. Those with bipolar disorder can be at risk for mania using light therapy.

Electroconvulsive therapy(ECT) uses electrical currents to induce a seizure, and hasbeen shownto help people with clinical depression. It’s used in people with severe depression or depression that is resistant to other treatments or antidepressant medications.

During an ECT procedure, you’ll receive an anesthetic agent which will put you to sleep for approximately 5 to 10 minutes.

Your healthcare professional will place cardiac monitoring pads on your chest and four electrodes on specific areas of your head. They will then deliver short electrical pulses for a few seconds. You will neither convulse nor feel the electrical current and will awaken about 5 to 10 minutes after treatment.

Side effectsincludeheadaches, nausea, muscle aches and soreness, and confusion or disorientation.

Patients may also develop memory problems, but these usually reside in the weeks and months after treatment

Ask your doctor about alternative therapies for depression. Many people choose to use alternative therapies alongside traditional psychotherapy and medication. Some examples include:

Aim for 30 minutes of physical activity 3 to 5 days a week.Exercisecan increase your body’s production ofendorphins, which are hormones that improve your mood.

Drinking alcohol or misusing substancesmay make you feel better for a little bit. But in the long run, these substancescanmake depression andanxietysymptoms worse.

Feeling overwhelmed can worsen anxiety and depression symptoms.Setting boundariesin your professional and personal life can help you feel better.

You can also improve symptoms of depression by taking care of yourself. This includes getting plenty ofsleep,eating a healthy diet, avoiding negative people, and participating in enjoyable activities.

Sometimes depression doesn’t respond to medication. Your healthcare professional may recommend other treatment options if your symptoms don’t improve.

These options includeelectroconvulsive therapy (ECT)orrepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)to treat depression and improve your mood.

Several types of supplements may have some positive effect on depression symptoms. Take care to discuss any new supplements you may be taking with your healthcare team, as some supplements can have significant side effects or interact with medication.

Someresearchsuggests this compound may ease symptoms of depression. The effects were best seen in people takingSSRIs. However, the results of this research is not conclusive and more research is needed.

5-HTPmay raiseserotonin levels in the brain, which could ease symptoms. Your body makes this chemical when you consume tryptophan, a building block of protein. However, more studies are needed.

These essential fats are important to neurological development and brain health. Addingomega-3 supplementsto your dietmay helpreduce depression symptoms. However, there is some conflicting evidence and more research is needed.

Always talk to your doctor before taking supplements, as they may interact with other medications or have negative effects.

Vitamins are important to many bodily functions. Research suggests two vitamins are especially useful for easing symptoms of depression:

Many herbs, supplements, and vitamins claim to help ease symptoms of depression, but most haven’t shown themselves to be effective in clinical research.

Learn about herbs, vitamins, and supplements that have shown some promise, and ask your healthcare professional if any are right for you.

There isn’t a single test to diagnose depression. But your healthcare provider can make a diagnosis based on your symptoms and a psychological evaluation.

In most cases, they’ll ask aseries of questionsabout your:

Because depression can be linked to other health problems, your healthcare professional may also conduct a physical examination and order blood work. Sometimesthyroid problemsor avitamin D deficiencycan trigger symptoms of depression.

It’s important not to ignore symptoms of depression. If your mood doesn’t improve or gets worse, seek medical help. Depression is a serious mental health illness with the potential for complications.

If left untreated, complicationscan include:

Depression can be broken into categories depending on the severity of symptoms. Some people experience mild and temporary episodes, while others experience severe and ongoing depressive episodes.

There are twomain types: major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder.

Major depressive disorder(MDD) is the more severe form of depression. It’s characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness that don’t go away on their own.

In order to be diagnosed with clinical depression, you must experience five or more of the following symptoms over a 2-week period:

There are different subtypes of major depressive disorder, which the American Psychiatric Association refers to as “specifiers.”

Theseinclude:

Persistent depressive disorder(PDD) used to be called dysthymia. It’s a milder, but chronic, form of depression.

In order for the diagnosis to be made, symptoms must last for at least2 years. PDD can affect your life more than major depression because it lasts for a longer period.

It’s common for people with PDD to:

Depression can be treated successfully, but it’s important to stick to your treatment plan.

Read more about why depression treatment is important.

Living with depression can be difficult, but treatment can help improve your quality of life. Talk to your healthcare professional about possible options.

The Healthline FindCare toolcan provide options in your area if you don’t already have a doctor.

Postpartum depressionrefers to depression that happens after childbirth. It is a common disorder after pregnancy, affecting1 in 9 new parents.

It’s common for people to experience “baby blues,” or feelings of sadness or emptiness after childbirth. For many people, these symptoms go away in a couple of days.

But if you feel sad, hopeless, or empty for longer than 2 weeks post-childbirth, you may have postpartum depression.

Symptoms of postpartum depression can range from mild to severe and caninclude:

Postpartum depression is thought to betriggered bythe dramatic hormonal changes that take place after pregnancy.

Bipolar depression occurs in certain types ofbipolar disorderwhen a person experiences a depressive episode.

Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder thatcausesdistinct changes in mood, energy, concentration, and the ability to carry out your day-to-day tasks.

There are three types of bipolar disorder, all of which include periods known as manic episodes, where you feel extremely “up,” elated, or energized, and depressive episodes where you feel “down,” sad, or hopeless.

If you have bipolar disorder, it can be hard to recognize the harmful effects of each “mood episode.”

People having a depressive episodemay:

Symptoms during a depressive episode last every day for most of the day and can last for several days or weeks.

If bipolar disorder is treated, many will experience fewer and less severe symptoms of depression, if they experience depressive episodes.

These 7 treatments may help ease symptoms of bipolar depression.

Depression andanxietycan occur in a person at the same time. In fact, research has shown that over70 percentof people with depressive disorders also have symptoms of anxiety.

Though they’re thought to be caused by different things, depression and anxiety can produce several similar symptoms, which can include:

The two conditions also share some common treatments.

Both anxiety and depression can be treated with:

If you think you’re experiencing symptoms of either of these conditions or both of them, make an appointment to talk with your healthcare professional. You can work with them toidentify coexisting symptoms of anxiety and depressionand how they can be treated.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD) causes unwanted and repeated thoughts, urges, and fears (obsessions).

These fears cause you to act out repeated behaviors or rituals (compulsions) that you hope will ease the stress caused by the obsessions.

People diagnosed with OCD frequently find themselves in a loop of obsessions and compulsions. If you have these behaviors, you may feel isolated because of them. This can lead to withdrawal from friends and social situations, which can increase your risk for depression.

It’s not uncommon for someone with OCD to also have depression. Having one anxiety disorder can increase your odds for having another. Up to80 percentof people with OCD also have depression episodes.

This dual diagnosis is a concern with children, too. Their compulsive behaviors, which may be first developing at a young age, can make them feel unusual. That can lead to withdrawing from friends and can increase the chance of a child developing depression.

Some individuals who have been diagnosed with major depression may also have symptoms of another mental disorder calledpsychosis. When the two conditions occur together, it’s known as “major depressive disorder, severe with psychotic features,” ordepressive psychosis.

Depressive psychosis causes people to see, hear, believe, or smell things that aren’t real. People with the condition may also experience feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and irritability.

The combination of the two conditions is particularly dangerous. That’s because someone with depressive psychosis may experience delusions that cause them to have thoughts of suicide or to take unusual risks.

It’s unclear what causes these two conditions or why they can occur together, but treatment can successfully ease symptoms. Treatments include medications andelectroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

Understanding the risk factors and possible causes can help you be aware of early symptoms.

Read more about depressive psychosis, how it’s treated, and what healthcare professionals understand about why it occurs.

Pregnancy is often an exciting time for people. However, it can still be common for a pregnant woman to experience depression.

Symptoms ofdepression during pregnancyinclude:

Treatment for depression during pregnancy may focus entirely on talk therapy and other natural treatments.

While some women do take antidepressants during their pregnancy, it’s not clear which ones are the safest. Your healthcare provider may encourage you to try an alternative option until after the birth of your baby.

The risks for depression can continue after the baby arrives.Postpartum depression, which is also called major depressive disorder with peripartum onset, is a serious concern for new mothers.

Recognizing the symptoms may help you spot a problem and seek help before it becomes overwhelming.

Research has established a link between alcohol use and depression. People who have depression are more likely to misuse alcohol.

Out of the 20.2 million U.S. adults who experienced a substance use disorder, about50 percenthad a co-occurring mental illness.

Drinking alcohol frequently can make symptoms of depression worse, and people who have depression are more likely to misuse alcohol or become dependent on it.

Depression isn’t generally considered to be preventable. It’s hard to recognize what causes it, which means preventing it is more difficult.

But once you’ve experienced a depressive episode, you may be better prepared to prevent a future episode by learning which lifestyle changes and treatments are helpful.

Techniques that may help include:

Other techniques and ideas may also help you prevent depression.

Read the full list of 15 ways you may be able to avoid depression.

Depression can be temporary, or it can be a long-term challenge. Treatment doesn’t always make your depression go away completely.

However, treatment often makes symptoms more manageable. Managing symptoms of depression involves finding the right combination of medications and therapies.

If one treatment doesn’t work, talk with your healthcare professional. They can help you create a different treatment plan that may work better in helping you manage your condition.

Jacki entered my office sullen and mystified. She said she had every reason to be happy. She had a loving husband whom she adored, two healthy young sons, a pretty house in the suburbs, a job where colleagues treated her well, and financial stability. But she had trouble getting out of bed in the morning, didn't feel like going out with friends, and lost interest in having sex. She told me she couldn't figure out why she was so miserable.

David, another patient, confessed to me that he entered intotherapyonly because his wife threatened that she woulddivorcehim if he didn't do something to improve his mood and behavior. He complained that his wife just didn't take the sources of hisstressseriously. His business was facing enormouscompetition. He was worried about the future of his company. Plus, running to and from his elderly parents' apartment to care for them, driving them to doctor visits, and ensuring that their aide was properly caring for them took every last ounce of his energy. In the little time he had to relax at home, he sat in front of the TV, not making conversation, and snapped at his wife if she made any requests. He just wanted to be left alone.

When I met with David and his wife together, her perspective was different. She said his business was going fabulously well, and even shared some details about the company's revenue. She was nervous though, that David's constant distractions with worries would have a negative impact on his employees, hisdecision making, the success of his business, and their family's financial stability. There seemed to be a total disconnect between David's very convincing view of what was going on and the reality of the situation—a hallmark ofdepression. One thing was clear to both of them: David's wife was exasperated. She was experiencingthe ripple effects of depression.

Jacki and David were both demonstrating typical signs of depression. But like many people who suffer from the condition, they didn't realize it. For Jacki, there was a chronic underlying sadness and emptiness that she couldn't explain. David pointed to his business worries as therationalizationfor his moodiness and behavior. What he didn't recognize is that hisnegative thinkingand persistent work concerns were his depression "talking."

It's common, of course, for people, to experience the blues and the :"blahs." Life is not always exciting. There are challenges that inevitably present themselves, It can be tough sometimes to muster positive energy when the weather has been consistently gray or rainy or you feel overwhelmed withworkresponsibilities, or are dealing with a demanding boss. There are times when we each feellonelyor aregrievingfrom loss. So how can you know when what you're going through fits the medical definition of depression?

Depression manifests in three ways:physically, emotionally,andcognitively.

Everyone experiences some of the symptoms I outlined above at different points in their lives. There is almost always a reason someone can point to in order to rationalize their feelings and behaviors, After all, life presents difficult challenges, illness, andloss and mourning—and these affect each of us. So how can you know if you're depressed?

The answer lies in theintensity, frequency,andphysicalityof your symptoms.If your symptoms last longer than two weeks. If you can't snap out of your irritable mood at home or at work, if you're so anxious that you can't enjoy happy occasions or so bitter that youcan't be thankfulfor the good things in your life, if you're frequently indecisive or have trouble focusing, if you are tired all the time and have low libido—you are exhibiting classic signs of depression.

Unfortunately, some people feel ashamed about being depressed. Thestigmaassociated with mental health challenges is not just unfortunate, it is dangerous. It prevents many people from seeking help. It also has a ripple effect—hurtingmarriages, friendships, and how you perform atyour workplace. Depression is a very common health issue. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, in 2023, 21 million adults experienced a major depressive episode. A 2023 Gallup poll reported that 29 percent of Americans report having been diagnosed with depression in their lifetime.

The good news is that if you have depression there is an excellent chance that your condition can be resolved with psychotherapies, likecognitive behavioraltherapy (CBT), and/or pharmacological agents, of which there are many and which can be mixed and matched to target your individual symptoms.

Are you skeptical about overcoming your depression? That is typical of the way depressed people think. They are certain that nothing will and nobody can help them. After all,negative thinkingis a classic sign of depression! The solution is this: Get thee to a healer! Schedule a consultation with a psychiatrist. Give CBT a go, and if that doesn't seem to work, keep in mind that there are excellentpsychiatricmedications.

The chances of a successful recovery from depression are superb. Depression is never inevitable. Not after the loss of a job, a loved one, or amarriage. Sadness is normal, yes. But when one is paralyzed by despair, chances are it's a biological depression and the symptoms being experienced are a part of it. There are always going to be situations that elicit moodiness, worry,sleeplessness, and other depressive symptoms But, generally, these symptoms come and go. If they begin to rule your life, please seekhelp. If you are thinking that depression is something you can just snap out of, think again. This is not a bad mood. This is not about you being weak and needing to work to cure yourself. Just like you wouldn't ignore having a diabetic, cancerous, or heart condition, don't ignore signs of depression. As I have seen over and over in my practice, people not only survive depression but, when treated well, they thrive!

Check off all that apply to you:

If you've checked off any of the above, schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist. You deserve to lead your best life.

It’s increasingly common for someone to be diagnosed with a condition such as ADHD or autism as an adult. A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers.


This quiz can’t replace a clinical diagnosis. If you believe you might have depression or another condition after taking this test, consider reaching out to a qualified professional about your symptoms.

We all go through ups and downs in life. We have those moments of elation and those moments when we feel sad or down.

Feeling down from time to time is not unusual, but when those moments seem to hang on and just won’t let go, it might mean you have depression.

Depressionis one of the most common widespread mental health conditions globally and one of the most misunderstood. TheWorld Health Organization (WHO)estimates that depression affects approximately 280 million people worldwide.

Depression can look different from person to person, and the intensity of each symptom can also vary.

But you’re not alone. If you’re experiencing symptoms of depression, support is available to help you manage your symptoms.

If you or someone you know is in crisis, help is available right now. You can:

If you’re not in the U.S., you can find a helpline in your country withBefrienders Worldwide.

This brief, time-saving questionnaire is designed for anyone who thinks they may be experiencing symptoms of depression.

The items in the quiz will help you determine whether you may need additional help and professional support for your symptoms.

A mental health professional can also help figure out if your issues might be a symptom of depression and recommend treatment if needed.

This online screening isnota definitive tool. It is not designed to diagnose depression or take the place of a professional diagnosis.

But you can use this test as a self-screening tool to track your moods. It also might show your doctor how your symptoms have changed from one visit to the next.

Only a trained medical professional, such as a doctor or mental health professional, can help you determine the next best steps for you.

According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 1 out of every 6 adults in the United States will experience depression.

If you have depression, you may experience:

A healthcare professional will speak with you to evaluate depressive symptoms you may be experiencing within a 2-week time period and to learn more about your family’s health history.

They may also order blood tests to ensure there are no underlying conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies.

According to the DSM-5, you must display at least five of the main symptoms of depression for over two weeks to get a diagnosis.

A mental health professional, such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or clinical social worker, can diagnose your condition.

You may also consider discussing your concerns with a healthcare professional for an initial diagnosis.

A healthcare professional can then help connect you with a mental health professional for further evaluation and treatment.

While everyone has experienced sadness, not everyone has experienced depression. In fact, if you’ve never been depressed, chances are that you don’t have a real grasp on what living with this complex mental illness is like.

Depression is insidious. It affects not only your mood, but also your ability to feel, think, and function. It blunts sensations of pleasure, closes off connectedness, stifles creativity, and, at its worst, shuts down hope. It also often causes deep emotional pain not only to the person experiencing it, but to that person’s close family and friends.

If sadness alone isn’t a good gauge of depression, what is? According to theAmerican Psychiatric Association’s (APA)currentDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM-5), which is the diagnostic guide used by most mental health professionals, if you’ve experienced at least five of the following symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks, you may bediagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD), also known as clinical depression.

No one knows for sure why some people become depressed and others do not. Depression can occur spontaneously, without any obvious cause. And it’s well documented that once you’ve had one depressive episode, your risk of having another later in life increases.

Psychiatrists today generally look at depression in “bio-psycho-social” terms, meaning that they see it as a complex disorder most likely triggered by overlapping biological, psychological, and social (also referred to as environmental) factors, according to astudy published in August 2019 inPsychiatric Times.

Among the potential contributors to depression are:

To be diagnosed with MDD, one of your symptoms must be a persistent low mood or a loss of interest or pleasure, theDSM-5states. Your symptoms must also not be due to substance abuse or a medical condition, such asthyroid problems, abrain tumor, or a nutritional deficiency.

Of course, it’s normal to have any or all of these symptoms temporarily (for hours or even days) from time to time. The difference with depression is that the symptoms persist and make it difficult to function normally.

If you suspect you may be depressed, the best first step is to reach out to your primary care doctor, apsychiatrist, or a psychotherapist. Also, know thatdepression screeningsmay now be a part of routine checkups. As of June 2023, theU.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)recommends that primary care providers screen all adults for depression, including pregnant and postpartum people and older adults.

If you’re reluctant to consult a professional, type “depression” or “clinical depression” into Google on your cellphone or computer and you’ll find links to a clinically validated depression test known as thePHQ-9 patient health questionnaire. Although designed to be administered by a healthcare professional, this test is short and straightforward. Take it and you can immediately see if your score indicates you may have depression.

Important: If you suspect you have depression, or if you’re feeling troubled by your symptoms, have suicidal thoughts, just need to talk, want some advice, or need a referral for treatment, call theSuicide and Crisis Lifeline(formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) at the three-digit code988, or the National Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357). Both are free and available 24/7, 365 days a year.

One reason depression can be hard to identify is that its signs can vary widely from person to person and sometimes be masked by atypical symptoms. For example, some people who are depressed may show it by acting disgruntled, resentful, or irritable. In fact, aggression — including outright acts of violence — can be indicative of “hidden” depression, according to areport published in February 2017 inPsychiatric Times. Depression masquerading as anger may seem surprising at first, but not when you consider that several underlying factors, including alcohol or substance abuse and childhood trauma, have been linked to both.

Similarly, although it’s not clear why, a person who experiences anxiety is at high risk for developing depression, and vice versa. The National Alliance on Mental Illness reports that as many as 60 percent of people with anxiety will also have symptoms of depression; the same goes for people with depression havingsymptoms of anxiety. Experts say there is often a genetic predisposition for these co-occurring disorders, according toHartgrove Behavioral Health System.

Depression may also manifest psychosomatically, meaning that instead of presenting first and foremost as a mood disorder, the dominant symptom may be things like vague aches,dizziness, headaches,digestive problems, orback pain, according to areview published in theJournal of Clinical Psychiatry. Complicating matters is that it’s often hard to know whether depression is causing the physical symptoms, or if the physical symptoms are causing depression.

How long depression lasts varies from person to person, but according to theDSM-5, a depressive episode lasts at least two weeks.

Untreated depressive episodes appear to last 6 to 12 months, according toStatPearls. Depression also tends to be chronic, with episodes happening again in about half of people who’ve experienced one depressive episode, 70 percent of people who’ve had two episodes, and 90 percent of people who’ve had three episodes. But some people never experience another episode after the first one.

If you suspect that depression is interfering with your life, talking about what you’re experiencing and discussing treatment options with a medical professional is essential. As actress Taraji P. Henson, who describes her depression as “suffocating” darkness, recently explained in an interview withSelf, “When you’re quiet, things aren’t fixed. It gets worse.”

The good news is that there’s abundant evidence that people with depression who seek treatment will find significant relief from talk therapy (psychotherapy),medication, lifestyle changes, or a combination of all efforts, according to theAnxiety and Depression Association of America.

TheSociety of Clinical Psychologyrates several types of psychotherapy as highly effectivetreatments for depression:

The most commonly prescribedantidepressantscause changes in brain chemistry that affect how neurons communicate. Exactly how this improves mood remains somewhat of a mystery, but the fact that they do often work is well-established. If you’re thinking about trying antidepressants, talk to your doctor about whether these treatments could be right for you.

All antidepressants can have side effects, but some may be more problematic than others. You may need to try several different medications, or a combination, guided by your doctor, before you find what works best for you.

In addition, it may take some patience before you see results. The full benefits of the drugs may not be realized until you’ve taken them for as long as three months, according to the theSTAR*D trial, the largest, longest study on antidepressant treatment, which ended in 2006.

Sometimes, other medications may be added to your regimen, depending on the form of depression, severity of your symptoms, and your response to other therapies. These might include a mood stabilizer, such aslithium(sold under several brand names) orvalproic acid (Depakene, Depakote). If symptoms of psychosis (having delusions or seeing or hearing voices that are not real, for example) are present, a doctor may prescribe an antipsychotic medication, such ashaloperidol (Haldol),risperidone (Risperdal),ziprasidone (Geodon),aripiprazole (Abilify), andolanzapine (Zyprexa).

Some experts believe that using an antipsychotic in combination with an antidepressant may be more effective for depressive disorders than antidepressants alone, according to areview published inShanghai Archives of Psychiatry.

Lifestyle changes, such as making art, journaling, exercising more, and practicingyogaor mindfulness, can also alleviate depression and the stress that can heighten it. Alternative treatments like massage,acupuncture, and light therapy may also help.

Diet changes, too, can uplift your mood by reducing inflammation and helping to ensure your brain gets the nutrients it needs to function at its best.

One small randomized controlledstudy, published October 9, 2019, in the journalPLoS One, found that self-reported symptoms of depression dropped significantly in just three weeks in young adults who changed from a highly processed, high-carbohydrate diet to aMediterranean dietfocused on vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, unsweetened dairy, nuts and seeds, olive oil, and the spicesturmericand cinnamon. In contrast, the depression scores didn’t budge in a control group of people who didn’t change their diet.

No, but it’s easy to see why some people might think so, because of a medical condition called antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS), which can occur if you abruptly stop taking medication rather than tapering off as is generally advised. ADS is marked by a wide range of responses, including but not limited to flu-like symptoms, insomnia, worsening mood, and stomach distress, according to areport published March 11, 2019, inPsychiatric Times.

Current estimates are that up to 40 percent of patients who’ve taken an antidepressant for at least a month will experience ADS symptoms if they abruptly stop their medication instead of lowering their dose gradually, according to astudy published December 2018 inThe American Journal of Psychiatry. (Conversely, more than 60 percent of patients who stop taking anSSRIwill have no significant symptoms.) Tapering under the care of a doctor can prevent ADS by allowing the brain to adjust to changes in neurotransmitter levels.

More to the point, while you should slowly stop your antidepressant with the help of your doctor, antidepressants do not cause dependence and withdrawal like other substances. Unlike substances that are known to cause addiction, such as alcohol,opioids, andbarbiturates, people don't crave antidepressants. You don’t get “high” from them, and they aren’t intentionally or compulsively overused. Serious reactions like the seizures and agitation that can follow sudden withdrawal from addictive substances are “unheard of when these antidepressants are tapered gradually,” note the authors of thePsychiatric Timesreport.

If you’ve tried at least two different antidepressants and your depression hasn’t improved, you may be diagnosed withtreatment-resistant depression (TRD). TRD is a serious condition that has been highly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Thirty percent of people with TRD attempt suicide in their lifetime, more than double the rate of their treatment-responsive peers, according to areview published in April 2018 in theJournal of Affective Disorders. It is not, however, a hopeless condition. A number of alternative treatment approaches are available, including:

If you’re wondering how to prevent depression, unfortunately there’s no surefire way. But according to Mayo Clinic, these steps could help:

Try your best to curb stress in your life.

Depression can worsen and take a significant toll on your mental and physical health if it’s not properly treated, according toMayo Clinic. Potentialcomplications of depressioninclude:

Unfortunately, there are plenty of people who know exactly what it means to be depressed. In 2020, an estimated 21 million, or 8.4 percent, of adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in the past year, according to theNational Institute of Mental Health, making it one of the most commonmental illnessesin the United States.

What’s more, a recent report from Mental Health America, a nonprofit founded in 1909, offers startling statistics pertaining to one of depression's most disturbing symptoms: thoughts of suicide.

According to its2023 State of Mental Health in America report, suicidal ideation among adults has reached 4.84 percent (more than 12.1 million people).

There is a bright side. Although there is no one-size-fits-all cure for depression, there are many effective treatment options, one of which is bound to help you heal if you’re struggling with the illness. This cannot be emphasized enough, given that roughly two-thirds of people living with depression do not receive the care they need, according to areport published online February 22, 2019, in the journalNeuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment.

When it comes to depression, there is a distinct gender gap. Depression is nearly twice as common in women as in men, according to data from theNational Center for Health Statistics. Hormonal and other biological factors play a role in this disparity. After all, only cisgender women and people with a uterus can have premenstrual or postpartum depression. The same is true of antepartum (or perinatal) depression —depression during pregnancy— which theAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologistsestimates affects 1 in 10 pregnant women.

Research on depression within communities of color has revealed a number of differences in the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment between people of color and white communities.

The symptoms of depression may appear differently among people of color compared with white people, according to the study from February 2019 inNeuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment. For instance, while white people are more likely to have acute depressive episodes, African American people are more likely to experience depression that’s more chronic, prolonged, and debilitating.

In anotherstudy, published in December 2022 inNursing Research, which was focused primarily on Black and African American mothers, participants were more likely to report self-blame, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and an inability to experience pleasure than some of the hallmark symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness or sadness.

Importantly, the authors of the study noted, traditional depression screening tools may not capture these symptoms, meaning depression may go undetected in some Black and African American women.

Among Black and Hispanic people, major depression goes undiagnosed and is undertreated at a much greater rate than among white people, according to areport published in May 2022 by Blue Cross Blue Shield. When these communities do receive treatment, prescription medication and counseling are utilized less often than in white communities, the report noted.

When it comes to treatment, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities are the least likely racial group to seek professional mental health services, according toMental Health America. That’s often due to factors like a lack of accessible resources, language barriers, and cultural stigmas surrounding mental health issues.

When your provider evaluates you for depression, it’s important that they rule out any other potential conditions that could be causing your symptoms. Conditions that may overlap with MDD, according to StatPearls, include:

Importantly, some people may have at least one of the above conditions in addition to depression, according toresearch published in February 2015 in theJournal of Medical Internet Research. Having multiple mental health conditions at the same time is what’s known as psychiatric comorbidity.

What does it mean to feel overwhelmed?

Why do you feel overwhelmed?

4 consequences of emotional overwhelm

These mental health issues can worsen your feelings of overwhelm

How to deal with overwhelm at work

Learn to control overwhelm so it doesn’t control you

Life's hectic — you’ve got professional and personal obligations, plus hobbies you care about and dreams you’re pursuing. It’s no wonder you feel overwhelmed sometimes.

But you might wonder, is everyone else feeling the same way? You could be experiencingnegativethoughts,self-doubt, and poor well-being, which might make you wonder, “Why am I easily overwhelmed?”

Don’t worry — it’s not just you.Approximately 73% of Americans say stress affects their mental health. But by learning what causes you to feel overwhelmed, the consequences, and how to deal with it, you can take control back.

When you feel overwhelmed, you're overcome by emotions because something feels too stressful or hard to handle. Your emotional response, often combined with a physical reaction, inhibits your ability to think clearly or plan how to handle a situation.

The physical reaction often feels similar to stressand anxiety— shallow breath, chest pressure, a racing heartbeat, sweating, etc. Or, you might shut down, trying not to think aboutstressors— like a meeting or job interview — to avoid feeling overwhelmed.

This experience often stems from feeling like things are out of your control — like life’s happening to you and you’re not an active agent. You have too many emails, social events, or obligations, and the mountain of things feels impossible to tackle.

Feeling overwhelmed also oftencauses procrastination. You see the mountain of tasks in front of you and think you can’t handle them, so don’t work on any of them.

Feelings are personal — why you experience overwhelm likely differs from others.

It takesself-awarenessto tune into your stressors and how they make you feel. Noting what triggers your overwhelm is the first step to removing certaintypes of stressfrom your life or learning how to handle them better.

Stress isn’t always a bad thing. The positive form of stress is calledeustress (as opposed to distress), and it’s a feeling that helps you stay motivated and focused and perform to the peak of your abilities. But when stress causes you to feel overwhelmed and impacts your well-being, it’s worth pinpointing and reducing the cause.

Here are four causes of emotional overwhelm to consider:

Life is full and complex — you have professionalroles and responsibilities, personal obligations, passions, and hobbies. But sometimes, you might take on too much, and the never-ending task list will make you shut down.

A conflict between your professional and personal life can also result in emotional overload. Things like covering during a coworker’s vacation time while managing grad school activities, or leading a high-visibility project at work while trying to support a family member, might be too much.

You’ll experience plenty of change throughout your life — it’s the only constant. Sometimes change is exciting and positive, but it can also be overwhelming. Moving to a new city,starting a new job, orreturning to schoolare big shifts. These new situations might make you feel overwhelmed.

Undergoingtraumais always overwhelming, and remembering those traumatic events often triggers this overwhelm.Losing loved ones, being in an accident, or natural disasters are examples of traumatic events.

You fear things for a reason. Situations likepublic speakingor being in large crowds can create overwhelming feelings because you think you can’t handle these situations. Avoiding your fears is also common, which might make you feel less prepared when confronted by them.

Being overwhelmed isn't something you should ignore. The consequences will impact yourmental health,physical health, mood, and daily habits. Perhaps you thought you were free once you overcame that moment of overwhelm. But just asstress can have long-term impacts on your healthand wellness, so does feeling overwhelmed repeatedly.

Here are four consequences of emotional overwhelm:

Difficulty taking care of yourself:When you focus on what's overwhelming you, you sometimes have trouble taking care of yourself. You could forget things like making a doctor's appointment or making time topractice self-care.

Lower ability to think rationally:Overstimulation brought on by fears or stressors can take over your mind. As a result,you can’t process things rationallyorthink critically. This can lead to procrastination or seeing something as more complicated than it is and giving up.

Negative impacts on your social life:Feeling overwhelmed by things in life might lead tolonelinessorsocial isolation. You might not socialize with friends or family because adding another item to your list is just too much.

Increased fatigue:It’s exhausting to be constantly overwhelmed. Being so tenseand stresseddrainsyour energyand makes you feel sluggish and unmotivated.

Other co-existing health issues often contribute to one feeling overwhelmed. Here are six common mental health conditions that either contribute to feelings of overwhelm or make you less able to function effectively under pressure and stress:

If you struggle with any of the above conditions, consider reaching out to amental health professionalfor support. They’ll help you navigate the underlying conditions that amplify your feelings of overwhelm and other symptoms.

Workplace mental health is important to prioritize so employees feel healthy, happy, and prepared toask for help when necessary. A study found that in 2021, around66% of surveyed Americans mentioned mental health struggles to someone at work.

Feeling overwhelmed at work interfereswith productivity,workplace satisfaction, andhow much you learn.But try some of the following strategies to see if any reduce the frequency and intensity at which you experience overwhelm.

Learn to say “No”:If you find it difficult or scary to say “No" to events or projects, even when you know your plate’s too full, think about the consequences of once again accepting more than you can handle.

Think about what you’re actually saying “No” to, whether that’s going to bed early or getting in a workout when you say “Yes” to something else.Disappointing someoneby saying “No” can feel scary, but overwhelming yourself trying to deliver what you promised isn’t the best alternative.

Stopall-or-nothing thinking:Prioritize tasks and responsibilities and scale efforts to match. Not everything needs or deserves your full attention, and often completion is more important than perfection.

Delegate:Just because a project needs to be done doesn’t mean it has to be done by you. Consider whether you’re the best, or only, person for the task. If not,delegate the responsibilityto take something off your plate.

Accept your feelings:Sometimes you’ll feel even more overwhelmed when you’re also embarrassed or disappointed in yourself for your reaction and inability to “just deal with it.” Denying the validity of your feelings only makes you feel more stressed and unhappy.

Prioritizepositive thinkingand be proud when you slow down and showcare for yourself.

Try meditation:When you’re feeling overwhelmed, you’re unbalanced, and your life seems destined for chaos,meditation and other mindfulness exercisescan help you return to a place of tranquility.

They do so by turning your attention inward, easing tension in the body, andclearing your mind. Once you regain your calm, you’ll be better prepared to handle whatever life throws at you.

Feeling overwhelmed is normal, and stressing about it only makes it worse. Instead, with your new understanding of this experience, you’ll be able tostay motivatedto work onstress management techniquesand avoid overwhelming yourself.

Practicing progressivemuscle relaxation methods, questioning yourinner criticto let go of perfectionism, and saying “No” can all help you develop a new relationship with this feeling.

Life can often feel like a series of challenges, and you're not alone if you feel stretched thin. Work deadlines piling up. Kids’ schedules overflowing. Chores accumulating at home. Some days it seems our plates are never empty! As responsibilities snowball, even minor disruptions can feel like crushing setbacks. Anxiety whispers that you're dropping balls or letting people down.

We get it. Sometimes it helps to know that this overwhelmed feeling is only temporary. You're stronger than life's challenges, even if that seems impossible right now. Through self-compassion and actionable steps, you can begin to shift from feeling perpetually swamped to taking life in your stride.

Everyone feels overwhelmed at some point or another. But have you ever wondered why some situations trigger a cascade of stress while others don't? Some common culprits behind these feelings include:

Our lives are full of responsibilities, from work-related tasks and family commitments to societal obligations. When these pile up without enough time or resources to handle them, it's like having too many browser tabs open on a computer; eventually, the system lags or crashes.

The modern world constantly bombards us with images of “success,” be it through social media, TV ads, or peer comparisons. These sometimes unrealistic standards can lead to a sense of inadequacy and the feeling that we're never doing enough, which can push us into a state of overwhelm.

We live in a digital age, which means a constant influx of notifications, news, and noise. For some, especially thosesensitive to sensory stimuli, this constant bombardment can rapidly lead to feelings of being overwhelmed.

Past events and traumas, when not addressed, can act as an undercurrent to our current emotions. A seemingly innocuous situation can trigger a disproportionate response if it subconsciously reminds us of a past trauma or event.

Neurological and hormonal imbalances can also play a role. For some, brain chemistry makes them more susceptible to anxiety and overwhelming emotions. Conditions such as ADHD or anxiety disorders canexacerbate those feelingsor bring them on more quickly.

Humansinherently desiresome degree of control over their lives. When faced with unexpected challenges or situations where control is minimal or stripped away—like during a pandemic or a sudden job loss—feelings of helplessness and overwhelm can quickly take center stage.

Our anxiety does not come from thinking about the future, but from wanting to control it.

– Kahlil Gibran

Uncertainty and ambiguity about the future or the outcomes of specific events can stir up anxiety. Not knowing what to expect or being unable to predict outcomes can lead to rumination and a heightened sense of overwhelm.

💙 TryFacing Fearsfrom The Daily Move.

Realizing when you're on the brink of emotional overwhelm or already deep within its grip is crucial. We often brush these feelings aside or mistake them for fatigue or passing stress. However, understanding the signs can help you build effective coping mechanisms and possibly prevent the snowballing effect of emotional distress.

This isn’t the occasional stress we all experience, like before a big presentation or an important event. It’s a perpetual state of stress, a constant background noise. You might feel like there’s a weight on your shoulders that never lifts, making even mundane tasks seem insurmountable.

💙 Check out ourOvercome Stress and Anxietyseries.

If you continually worry about what-ifs and worst-case scenarios, or if you often feel uneasy or on edge , you might be experiencing emotional overwhelm . This pervasive anxiety goes beyond typical worries and can severely affect day-to-day functioning.

💙 Feeling anxious? Try thisCalming Anxietymeditation.

When we're overwhelmed, our emotional reservoir is nearly depleted. This means our tolerance for additional stressors, even minor ones, becomes extremely low. If you’re snapping at loved ones, getting frustrated over small things, or feeling restless, it’s a sign to take note of.

An overwhelmed mind often feels chaotic and cluttered, making it challenging to focus on the tasks at hand. Emotional overwhelm could be the culprit if you frequently lose track of your thoughts, struggle with decision-making, or feel paralyzed when trying to start a task.

Sometimes, emotional turmoil shows up physically. Symptoms can include headaches, stomach disturbances, muscle tension, changes in appetite, or sleep disturbances. We shouldn’t ignore these signs, as they can signal that our bodies are reacting to emotional stress.

One of the markers of emotional overwhelm is the desire to escape or avoid situations. This can show up as procrastination, social withdrawal, or even using substances as a coping mechanism.

You might feel emotionally drained, unable to express happiness, excitement, or any emotion with intensity. It's like running on an empty emotional tank, with feelings seeming muted or distant.

Emotional overwhelm isn't just in your head. It involves both mental and physical symptoms, profoundly impacting overall wellbeing. The silver lining is that you can empower yourself to take action by acknowledging that you’re overwhelmed.

💙 Try a guided practice likeManaging Overwhelmwhen things get to feel like they’re too much.

Pause and breathe:Before reacting, take deep breaths. This simple act can calm the mind and provide clarity.

List it out:Write down what's on your mind. Organizing your thoughts on paper can help in prioritizing and tackling them systematically.

Disconnect: Take a break from digital devices. Constant notifications can amplify feelings of overwhelm.

Engage in physical activity:Movement, whether a quick walk or a full workout, can release pent-up tension and stress.

Seek a change of scenery:Sometimes, just changing your surroundings, even if it's moving to a different room, can provide a fresh perspective.

Emotional resilience is the ability to bounce back from adversity, stress, or emotional upheaval. It doesn't mean you won't experience distress or heartache. Instead, it helps you navigate and manage these feelings. As life's challenges ramp up, it becomes increasingly vital to build resilience, ensuring we're better equipped to handle them.

Here are six actionable strategies to boost your emotional strength and combat overwhelming feelings.

Mindfulness is about staying anchoredin the present moment, observing feelings and thoughts without judgment.

This practice allows you to respond rather than react to situations, decreasing emotional reactivity. Grounding exercises, like the5-4-3-2-1 method(identifying five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste), can help pull you back into the present. Mindfulness is especially helpful when practiced as adaily habit.

Whether it's saying "no" to additionaltasks at workor setting aside personal time, boundaries are vital to prevent burnout and maintain emotional equilibrium.

💙Energy Managementwith Jay Shetty can help you learn to manage your energy the way you manage your time.

There's profound power in expressing your emotions and sharing your experiences. Talking to a trusted friend or family member or seeking professional therapy can offer valuable perspective and validation. Remember, seeking help isn't a sign of weakness; it's a proactive step toward your wellbeing.

Physical activity has a myriad of benefits for mental well-being, from releasing brain chemicals to improving sleep quality. Whether it's a brisk walk, yoga, or an intense workout, find what you love and stick with it. Complement this with self-care routines like journaling, reading, or hobbies to rejuvenate your mind and body.

Resilience isn't built overnight. It's an ongoing process of growth, understanding, and consistent effort. By integrating these tips into your life, you will find yourself better equipped to handle feelings of overwhelm and develop a healthy set of coping strategies with which to approach life's challenges.

Instead of viewing emotional resilience as a trait or a tool, consider it a lifestyle or a journey of self-awareness, growth, and evolution. Emotional health is a cornerstone of our overall wellbeing. And when we're emotionally strong, we're not just equipped tohandle daily stressbetter and more open to opportunities. The courage to try new things, the willingness to step out of our comfort zones, and the ability to build deeper, more meaningful relationships—all originate from a place of emotional strength.

Challenges no longer appear as insurmountable obstacles but as lessons, growth opportunities, and occasionally, even blessings in disguise. With a resilient mindset, setbacks are temporary, and victories, however small, are celebrated, creating a more fulfilling and positive life journey. So, rather than waiting until you’re overwhelmed to take action, prioritize your emotional health every day.

The strategies shared above can ease overwhelmed feelings. But it's important to note that many of the symptoms of overwhelm overlap with mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety. If life still feels relentlessly stressful after implementing changes, or if those changes feel impossible right now, please reach out to your healthcare provider.

Overwhelm is an intense feeling that things are too much to handle, whether mentally, emotionally, or both. It often occurs when we don’t believe that we are able to cope with the demands placed on us. It can affect us in many ways, from mental paralysis and difficulty making decisions to physical symptoms like exhaustion or headaches. Tasks, emotions, or situations can seem impossible.

The triggers for feeling overwhelmed are vast and varied, shaped by personal experiences, sensitivities, and current life circumstances. Common causes include excessive responsibilities, major life transitions, high expectations, chronic stressors (e.g., financial difficulties, chronic illnesses, or long-term relationship problems), and information overload.

Individuals with ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) might experience overwhelm in unique ways. Due to the nature of ADHD, challenges like difficulty prioritizing tasks, impulsivity, managing time effectively, or maintaining focus can contribute to a heightened sense of overwhelm. It can often feel like a never-ending swirl of thoughts, tasks, and distractions competing for attention, making it hard to settle on a single course of action or see a situation clearly.

💙 Explore ourADHD Support Series.

"Fixing" the sensation of being overwhelmed often requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some steps to consider:

Acknowledge the feeling:Recognize and validate your emotions. Denying or suppressing them can exacerbate the situation.

Break tasks into manageable chunks:Instead of viewing everything as one colossal mountain, break tasks or challenges into smaller, more manageable steps.

Mindfulness and grounding techniques:Meditation and mindfulness help anchor you in the present moment, offering a reprieve from spiraling thoughts. You can even combine meditation with thesoothing powers of nature.

Seek support:Talking through your feelings with someone you trust, be it a friend, family member, or therapist, can provide clarity and comfort.

Set boundaries:This can mean learning to say "no" or ensuring you take breaks when working on intensive tasks.

Engage in self-care:Activities you enjoy, ranging from reading a book to taking a walk, can help reset and recharge your emotional batteries.

Mental health is hard. Getting support doesn't have to be. TheCalm appputs the tools to feel better in your back pocket, with personalized content to manage stress and anxiety, get better sleep, and feel more present in your life.

The constant barrage of responsibilities, information, and expectations can leave us feeling like we’re drowning in a sea of stress. However, understanding the nature of overwhelming stress and learning effective strategies to combat it can help us regain control and find balance in our lives.

Overwhelming stress is a state of mental and emotional strain that occurs when the demands placed upon us exceed our perceived ability to cope. It’s more than just feeling busy or having a lot on your plate; it’s a sense of being completely submerged by responsibilities and unable to come up for air. This type of stress can be triggered by various factors, including work pressures, personal relationships, financial concerns, or major life changes.

By learning to recognize the signs of overwhelming stress and implementing effective coping strategies, we canovercome stress writingand other stress-inducing activities, leading to a more balanced and fulfilling life.

Before we can effectively manage overwhelming stress, it’s essential to recognize its manifestations. Stress can affect us in various ways, impacting our physical health, emotional well-being, behavior, and cognitive function.

Physical Symptoms:– Fatigue and low energy– Headaches or migraines– Muscle tension and pain– Digestive issues (e.g., stomachaches, nausea)– Rapid heartbeat or chest pain– Insomnia or changes in sleep patterns– Weakened immune system, leading to frequent illnesses

Recognizing these signs is the first step in addressing overwhelming stress. If you find yourselfdrowning in stress, it’s important to take action and implement strategies to regain control.

When you’re in the midst of feeling overwhelmed, it’s crucial to have quick, effective techniques at your disposal to help you regain your composure and clarity. Here are some immediate strategies you can use to cope with overwhelming feelings:

1. Deep Breathing Exercises:Deep breathing is a simple yet powerful technique that can help calm your nervous system and reduce stress. Try the 4-7-8 breathing technique:– Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds– Hold your breath for 7 seconds– Exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 seconds– Repeat this cycle 4-5 times or until you feel calmer

2. Grounding Techniques:Grounding helps you reconnect with the present moment and your physical surroundings, pulling you out of overwhelming thoughts. Try the 5-4-3-2-1 method:– Identify 5 things you can see– 4 things you can touch– 3 things you can hear– 2 things you can smell– 1 thing you can taste

3. Mindfulness Meditation:Mindfulness can help you observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment, reducing their power over you. Try this simple mindfulness exercise:– Find a quiet place and sit comfortably– Close your eyes and focus on your breath– When thoughts arise, acknowledge them without judgment and gently return your focus to your breath– Start with 5 minutes and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable

4. Progressive Muscle Relaxation:This technique involves tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups in your body, helping to release physical tension and promote relaxation:– Start with your toes and work your way up to your head– Tense each muscle group for 5 seconds, then relax for 10 seconds– Pay attention to the sensation of relaxation as you release the tension

These immediate strategies can provide quick relief when you’re feeling overwhelmed. However, it’s important to remember that managing stress is an ongoing process that requires consistent effort and practice.

While immediate coping strategies are essential for managing acute stress, developing long-term approaches is crucial for sustained stress management and overall well-being. Here are some effective long-term strategies to help you manage overwhelming stress:

1. Establishing a Regular Self-Care Routine:Self-care is not a luxury; it’s a necessity for maintaining mental and physical health. Create a self-care routine that includes activities you enjoy and that help you relax. This might include:– Reading a book– Taking a warm bath– Practicing yoga or stretching– Engaging in a hobby– Spending time in nature

Remember, self-care looks different for everyone, so find what works best for you and make it a non-negotiable part of your routine.

2. Prioritizing and Time Management Techniques:Effective time management can significantly reduce feelings of overwhelm. Try these techniques:– Use the Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance– Implement the Pomodoro Technique for focused work sessions– Create daily to-do lists, limiting them to 3-5 essential tasks– Use time-blocking to schedule your day and allocate specific time slots for different activities

3. Setting Realistic Goals and Expectations:Often, we feel overwhelmed because we set unrealistic expectations for ourselves. To combat this:– Break large projects into smaller, manageable tasks– Set SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)– Practice self-compassion and acknowledge that perfection is not attainable– Regularly reassess and adjust your goals as needed

4. Developing a Support Network:Having a strong support system can provide emotional relief and practical assistance when you’re feeling overwhelmed. To build your support network:– Cultivate relationships with friends, family, and colleagues who uplift and support you– Consider joining a support group or online community related to your specific stressors– Don’t hesitate to ask for help when you need it– Reciprocate support to strengthen your relationships

By implementing these long-term strategies, you can build resilience and create a solid foundation for managing stress in your life. Remember, it’s okay to start small and gradually incorporate these practices into your routine. The key is consistency and patience with yourself as you develop new habits.

In addition to immediate coping strategies and long-term approaches, making certain lifestyle changes can significantly reduce your overall stress levels and improve your ability to handle overwhelming situations. Here are some key areas to focus on:

1. Improving Sleep Habits:Quality sleep is essential for stress management and overall well-being. To improve your sleep:– Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends– Create a relaxing bedtime routine– Make your bedroom conducive to sleep (cool, dark, and quiet)– Limit screen time before bed– Avoid caffeine and heavy meals close to bedtime

2. Incorporating Regular Exercise:Physical activity is a powerful stress-buster. It releases endorphins, improves mood, and enhances overall health. To make exercise a regular part of your routine:– Find activities you enjoy, whether it’s walking, swimming, dancing, or team sports– Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week– Break exercise into smaller chunks throughout the day if you’re short on time– Consider joining a fitness class or finding an exercise buddy for accountability

3. Maintaining a Balanced Diet:What you eat can significantly impact your stress levels and overall health. To promote a stress-reducing diet:– Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins– Include foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as fatty fish, walnuts, and flaxseeds– Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day– Limit processed foods, sugary snacks, and excessive caffeine

4. Limiting Caffeine and Alcohol Intake:While many people turn to caffeine for energy and alcohol for relaxation, both can exacerbate stress when consumed in excess. To manage your intake:– Limit caffeine to 400mg per day (about 4 cups of coffee)– Avoid caffeine in the late afternoon and evening– Practice moderation with alcohol consumption– Find alternative ways to relax and unwind, such as herbal tea or meditation

By making these lifestyle changes, you can create a solid foundation for stress management and overall well-being. Remember that small, consistent changes can lead to significant improvements over time. Be patient with yourself as you work to incorporate these habits into your daily life.

While self-help strategies are valuable, there are times when professional assistance is necessary to effectively manage overwhelming stress. Recognizing when to seek help and understanding the available options can be crucial in your journey towards better stress management.

When to Consult a Mental Health Professional:– Your stress is interfering with daily functioning or relationships– You’re experiencing persistent feelings of anxiety or depression– You’re using unhealthy coping mechanisms (e.g., substance abuse, self-harm)– You’re having thoughts of self-harm or suicide– Your stress is related to past trauma or unresolved issues– Self-help strategies aren’t providing sufficient relief

Types of Therapy for Stress Management:1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): This approach helps you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to stress.

2. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR): This program combines mindfulness meditation and yoga to help you manage stress and improve overall well-being.

3. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): ACT focuses on accepting difficult emotions and committing to actions aligned with personal values.

4. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): This therapy teaches skills in mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.

5. Psychodynamic Therapy: This approach explores how past experiences and unconscious thoughts influence current behavior and stress responses.

The Role of Medication in Treating Overwhelming Stress:In some cases, medication may be recommended as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for managing stress, especially if it’s accompanied by anxiety or depression. Common medications include:– Antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs)– Anti-anxiety medications (e.g., benzodiazepines)– Beta-blockers (for physical symptoms of stress)

It’s important to note that medication should always be prescribed and monitored by a qualified healthcare professional, and it’s often most effective when combined with therapy and lifestyle changes.

Complementary and Alternative Treatments:In addition to traditional therapy and medication, many people find relief through complementary and alternative treatments. These may include:– Acupuncture– Massage therapy– Biofeedback– Hypnotherapy– Herbal supplements (e.g., ashwagandha, rhodiola)– Essential oils and aromatherapy

While these treatments can be beneficial, it’s important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new treatment, especially if you’re taking medications or have existing health conditions.

Seeking professional help is not a sign of weakness; rather, it’s a proactive step towards better mental health and stress management. A mental health professional can provide personalized strategies, support, and treatment options tailored to your specific needs and circumstances.

As we’ve explored throughout this article, feeling overwhelmed is a common experience in our fast-paced world, but it doesn’t have to control your life.

The key is torecognize the hidden dangers of unmanaged stressand continue applying these strategies consistently.

As you work on implementing these techniques, be mindful ofunhealthy ways to deal with stressthat might provide temporary relief but can be harmful in the long run. Instead, focus on building healthy coping mechanisms and lifestyle habits that support your overall well-being.

It’s also important to recognize that sometimes,self-inflicted stresscan contribute to feelings of overwhelm. Be aware of your own thought patterns and behaviors that might be exacerbating your stress levels, and work on addressing these as part of your stress management strategy.

If you find yourself struggling with persistentoverthinking, which can significantly contribute to stress and overwhelm, consider exploring specific techniques to manage this tendency and cultivate a more balanced thought process.

Ultimately, taking action is the most crucial step in managing overwhelming stress. Whether it’s implementing a new coping strategy, making a lifestyle change, or reaching out for professional help, every step you take is a move towards a calmer, more balanced life.

Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. Many people struggle with overwhelming stress, and there’s no shame in seeking support or taking time to prioritize your mental health. By taking proactive steps to manage your stress, you’re not only improving your own well-being but also setting a positive example for those around you.

As you continue on your path to better stress management, be kind to yourself, celebrate small victories, and remember thatlearning how to stop stressingis a skill that improves with practice. With persistence and the right tools, you can overcome overwhelming stress and cultivate a more peaceful, fulfilling life.

Feeling overwhelmed is a challenging and frustrating experience that affects us all at one point or another.

But if you are easily overwhelmed on a regular basis, have you ever stopped to ask why?

In this article, we’ll explore some of the most common reasons why people get overwhelmed, and we’ll provide tips and strategies to help you manage these feelings.

Armed with this information, you will be able to put a plan in place for coping more effectively.

But first…

Overwhelm is a feeling of being mentally or emotionally swamped, often resulting from a perceived inability to cope with the demands of a particular situation or set of circumstances.

It can manifest in many ways, including headaches, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, irritability, and depression.

When it’s left unaddressed, overwhelm can lead to burnout: a state of emotional, physical, and mental fatigue that can impact a person’s ability to function effectively in their personal and professional lives.

Therefore, managing overwhelming feelings is essential for maintaining overall well-being and preventing long-term negative consequences.

Having too much to docan significantly contribute to feelings of overwhelm.

When a person has a long list of tasks or responsibilities that they need to complete within a limited amount of time, it can lead to a sense of pressure and stress.It can feel like you’re drowning; like the to-do list is never-ending.

This can be especially true when deadlines are involved and the person feels like they are running out of time to complete everything.

In addition, when peopletry to do too much, they may struggle with prioritization and time management, further exacerbating overwhelming feelings.

As a result, they may become disorganized and unable to focus, making it even more challenging to complete tasks efficiently and successfully.

When a person has too much to do, they may feel like they are constantly playing catch-up, trying to stay on top of everything without ever feeling like they are truly making progress.

If you are struggling with too much to do, it may feel likeyour life is spiraling out of control. This can lead to a sense of futility and hopelessness as you struggle to find a way to manage your workload effectively.

When people feel overwhelmed by what they must do, they may experience physical symptoms such as tension headaches, muscle tightness, and fatigue.

Additionally, they may find it challenging to relax and unwind, which can further impact their ability to manage stress and feelings of overwhelm.

Overall, having too much to do can be a significant source of overwhelm that can have far-reaching consequences for a person’s mental and physical health.

Therefore, it’s important to recognize when you’re doing too much so you can focus on improving the situation.

One effective way to address overwhelm is to prioritize tasks and responsibilities based on their importance and urgency.

This involves taking a step back, assessing what needs to be done, and breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.

Setting realistic goals and expectations is also important, rather than trying everything simultaneously. This can help prevent feeling overwhelmed by breaking down tasks into smaller, achievable goals.

Another helpful strategy is to delegate tasks or responsibilities to others when possible. Delegating can help reduce workload and allow a person to focus on the most critical tasks.

Finally, it’s important to take breaks and practice self-care regularly. A few ideas to try are engaging in activities promoting relaxation and stress relief, like exercise, meditation, or leisure time in nature.

Major life changes can often lead to overwhelming feelings as they require a person to adapt to new circumstances and adjust their expectations and routines.

In clinical terms, you may be experiencing anadjustment disorder—which is defined in The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) as“The development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor(s) occurring within 3 months of the onset of the stressor(s).”

Whether it’s a new job, a move to a new city, or losing a loved one, major life changes can be disruptive, challenging, and disorienting. They can challenge a person’s sense of identity and require them to navigate unfamiliar situations, which can be stressful and overwhelming.

Additionally, major life changes can involve a lot of uncertainty and unpredictability, leaving a person feeling anxious and unsure of themselves.

When a person experiences a major life change, they may also experience a sense of loss or grief, which can further contribute to overwhelming feelings.

As a result, major life changes can be a significant source of stress that can impact a person’s mental and emotional well-being.

Examples of major life changes:

An effective way to cope with major life changes is to acknowledge and accept the situation as it is rather than trying to resist or deny it.

This involves being honest with oneself about what is happening and recognizing that change can be difficult but ultimately necessary for growth and progress.

It’s also important to seek support from family, friends, or a therapist who can provide emotional and practical support during the transition.

Additionally, practicing self-care is crucial during major life changes, as it can help reduce stress and promote feelings of well-being. This might involve engaging in exercise, meditation, or journaling activities.

It’s also important to maintain healthy habits, such as getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and avoiding excessive alcohol or drug use.

Finally, it’s important to be patient and kind to oneself during major life changes, recognizing that it may take time to adjust and adapt to new circumstances.

Grief is a natural and typical response to the loss of someone or something significant to a person.

However, it is a complex emotional experience that can involve a wide range of emotions, including sadness, anger, guilt, and confusion.

Grief can be triggered by a variety of losses, including the death of a loved one, the end of a significant relationship, or the loss of a job or home.

When a person is experiencing grief, they may feel overwhelmed by their emotions and find it challenging to manage their day-to-day activities.

Grief can lead to overwhelming feelings because it is a highly emotional and intense experience. When a person is grieving, they may struggle with sadness, anger, or despair, making it difficult to focus on anything else.

They may also experience physical symptoms, such as fatigue or insomnia, making it hard to function normally.

Additionally, the grieving process can be unpredictable and variable, making it difficult for a person to anticipate and manage their emotions.

Moreover, grief can be a long and complex process, and it can take time for a person to adjust to the new reality of their life. This can be particularly challenging when the loss is unexpected or sudden.

A person may feel like their world has been turned upside down and struggle to find their footing in the aftermath of the loss. As a result, grief can be a significant source of stress and overwhelm that can impact a person’s mental and emotional well-being.

An important thing a person can do when experiencing grief is to acknowledge and express their emotions. It’s essential to permit oneself to feel whatever emotions come up, whether it’s sadness, anger, or confusion.

It’s also important to seek support from friends, family members, or a therapist who can offer emotional support to help process those feelings.

Another helpful coping strategy is to engage in self-care practices. This can involve caring for one’s physical and emotional well-being by getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.

Participating in stress-reducing activities like meditation, yoga, or journaling can also help a person work through the physical and emotional symptoms of grief.

Finding ways to honor the lost person or thing is also essential. This can involve engaging in rituals, such as lighting candles or creating a memory box, which allows a person to remember and celebrate their loved one.

Giving oneself time and space to grieve and not rush the healing process is also important.

Finally, it’s vital to seek professional help if necessary. Grief can be a long and challenging process, and it’s not always easy to cope with alone. If a person feels like their grief is becoming overwhelming or interfering with their daily life, it is a good idea to seek out the support of a mental health professional.

Relationship conflicts can be a big source of stress and overwhelm for many people.

When a person experiences conflict in their relationships, whether it’s with a partner, family member, or friend, it can trigger a range of emotional responses, including anger, frustration, and sadness.

These emotions can be intense and challenging to manage, making a person feel overwhelmed and stressed.

Additionally, relationship conflicts can be ongoing and persistent, making it hard for a person to relieve their stress. They may find themselves constantly thinking about the conflict or trying to resolve the issue, which can lead to exhaustion, fatigue, and burnout.

Moreover, relationship conflicts can also trigger physical symptoms, like headaches or muscle tension, which can exacerbate a person’s stress levels.

Relationship conflicts can impact a person’s sense of identity and self-worth. If a person is experiencing conflict with someone they care about, it can be challenging to maintain a positive self-image and feel confident in themselves.

This can contribute to feelings of overwhelm and stress as a person struggles to cope with the emotional toll of the conflict.

Relationship conflicts can be a significant source of stress and overwhelm, and addressing and resolving them is very important. Seeking out the support of a therapist or counselor can help to learn effective communication and conflict resolution skills, which can help to reduce stress and improve relationships.

In addition, participating in self-care practices, such as exercise, meditation, or spending quality time with supportive friends and family, is also essential to help manage stress and maintain emotional well-being.

Coping with relationship conflicts can be challenging, but several strategies can help people manage their stress and maintain their emotional well-being. Here are a few tips:

Practice effective and safe communication:One of the best ways to cope with relationship conflicts is to practice effective communication. This involves listening actively, expressing oneself clearly and calmly, and avoiding blame and criticism. Communicating in this way can reduce the chances of misunderstandings and disagreements, which can help prevent conflicts from escalating.

Prioritize self-care:When dealing with relationship conflicts, take time for self-care. This can involve participating in activities that bring joy and relaxation, like exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones. Self-care can help reduce stress levels and improve emotional well-being, making it easier to manage conflicts.

Set boundaries:Sometimes, setting boundaries can help manage relationship conflicts. This involves being clear about what one will and will not tolerate in a relationship and communicating these boundaries assertively but respectfully. By setting boundaries, a person can reduce the likelihood of conflicts arising and protect their emotional well-being.

Seek support:Seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist can help manage relationship conflicts. Talking to a friend or family member can provide emotional support and help a person gain perspective on the situation. In addition, a therapist or counselor can offer practical advice and guidance on effective communication and conflict-resolution skills.

Be willing to compromise:It is essential to be willing to compromise when dealing with relationship conflicts. This involves being open to hearing the other person’s perspective and finding a solution that works for both parties. By being willing to compromise, a person can reduce the likelihood of conflict and maintain positive relationships.

Financial struggles can be a significant source of stress and can overwhelm individuals.

The constant pressure to make ends meet, pay bills, and manage debt can cause anxiety, depression, and feelings of hopelessness.

Financial difficulties can also lead to a sense of isolation and shame, as people may feel embarrassed to discuss their situation with others or fear being judged.

Additionally, financial struggles can impact other areas of a person’s life, such as relationships, health, and overall well-being, adding to the burden and stress.

Financial difficulties can be emotionally and mentally challenging, and individuals need to seek support and guidance to help alleviate some of the burdens.

TheUK Trauma Council describes traumaas referring to“[…]the way that some distressing events are so extreme or intensethat they overwhelm a person’s ability to cope, resulting in lasting negative impact.”

Traumatic events can leave deep scars that affect how individuals perceive themselves, others, and the world around them.

Unresolved trauma can also trigger various symptoms, including anxiety, depression, anger, and feelings of isolation. These symptoms can become overwhelming and interfere with daily life, making working, socializing, or carrying out everyday tasks difficult.

In addition, unresolved trauma can make individuals feel helpless, stuck, and unable to move forward, exacerbating overwhelming feelings.

Coping with unresolved trauma can be challenging, but there are steps individuals can take to manage overwhelming feelings and promote healing.

First, seeking support from a mental health professional can be a crucial step in addressing trauma. Therapy offers a safe and supportive environment to process emotions and develop coping skills.

Self-care practices, like exercise, meditation, and spending time in nature, can also help manage overwhelming feelings.

Additionally, building a support system of trusted friends and family can provide a sense of connection and validation.

It’s also important to recognize triggers that may evoke trauma memories and develop strategies to manage them, such as deep breathing, grounding techniques, or calming activities.

Finally, education about trauma and its impact can help individuals understand and normalize their experiences, which reduces feelings of isolation and shame.

With patience, persistence, and the proper support, individuals can cope with unresolved trauma and move forward positively.

Mental health conditions such as anxiety can cause a person to experience feelings of overwhelm.

Persistent feelings of worry, fear, and apprehension characterize anxiety. These feelings can become intense and overwhelming, making coping with everyday tasks and responsibilities difficult.

In addition, people with anxiety may experience physical symptoms such as a rapid heartbeat, excessive sweating, and shortness of breath. They may also have negative thoughts, racing thoughts, and difficulty concentrating, further exacerbating overwhelming feelings.

As a result, anxiety can interfere with daily life, making it challenging to carry out work, socialize, and other activities.

Navigating mental health conditions can be challenging, but there are steps individuals can take to manage symptoms and reduce feelings of overwhelm.

Finding support from a mental health professional is very helpful in managing mental health conditions. A therapist can provide tools and strategies to manage symptoms and offer a safe and supportive environment to discuss feelings and emotions.

Building a support network of trusted friends and family can also provide validation and a sense of connection.

Self-care practices like exercise, healthy eating, and getting good sleep can also help manage symptoms and reduce overwhelming feelings.

It’s essential to recognize triggers that can exacerbate mental health symptoms and develop strategies to manage them.

Mindfulness practices like deep breathing, meditation, and yoga can also help manage symptoms and promote relaxation.

Finally, educating oneself about the mental health condition and its impact can help reduce feelings of stigma and shame and provide a better understanding of how to manage symptoms.

Malnutrition can significantly impact a person’s physical and mental health, including feelings of overwhelm.

When the body does not receive the nutrients it needs to function correctly, it can lead to physical symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, and headaches, which can interfere with daily life.

In addition, malnutrition can affect brain function, leading to cognitive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, memory problems, and brain fog. These symptoms can become overwhelming, making it challenging to carry out daily tasks and responsibilities.

Malnutrition can also impact mood, leading to irritability, anxiety,and depression, which can exacerbate feelings of overwhelm.

Therefore, eating a balanced and nutritious diet is vital to avoid malnutrition and promote physical and mental well-being.

Being a perfectionist can lead to feelings of overwhelm because of the constant pressure to achieve high standards.

Perfectionists often set unrealistic expectations for themselves and may struggle to delegate tasks or seek help when needed, leading to a heavy workload and a lack of work-life balance.

When life doesn’t go as planned, or when mistakes are made, perfectionists may become highly critical of themselves, leading to negative self-talk and feelings of anxiety and stress.

Pursuing perfection can also cause individuals to prioritize work or achievement over self-care and relaxation, leading to burnout and exhaustion.

Learning to let go of perfection and embracing imperfection can help reduce feelings of overwhelm and promote a healthier and more balanced approach to life.

Set realistic goals:Instead of striving for perfection, set achievable and realistic goals. Break larger goals into smaller, more manageable ones to avoid feeling overwhelmed.

Practice self-compassion:Be kind, practice self-love, and be compassionate to yourself, acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes and it’s okay to be imperfect.

Challenge negative self-talk:Challenge negative thoughts and beliefs about yourself, and replace them with more positive and realistic ones.

Focus on progress, not perfection:Celebrate small accomplishments and recognize progress rather than only focusing on the end result.

Embrace failure:Accept that failure is a natural part of the learning process and use it as an opportunity to learn and grow.

Practice self-care:Make time for activities and routines that bring joy and relaxation, like hobbies, exercise, or spending time with loved ones.

Seek support:Talk to a therapist, counselor, or trusted friend or family member about your perfectionism and its impact on your life.

Learn to delegate:Accept help from others and delegate tasks when possible to avoid overloading yourself.

Manage expectations:Set realistic expectations for yourself and others and communicate them clearly.

Embrace imperfection:Recognize that perfection is not attainable and embrace imperfection as a natural and essential part of life.

Lack of sleep can cause feelings of overwhelm due to its impact on both physical and mental health.

Sleep is crucial in regulating mood, attention, and cognitive function. When we don’t get enough quality sleep, it can result in irritability, mood swings, and difficulty concentrating.

Additionally, the body needs adequate rest to restore energy levels and promote physical health.

Sleep deprivation can lead to physical symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, and muscle aches, which can interfere with daily activities and contribute to overwhelming feelings.

Lack of sleep can also negatively impact the immune system, making individuals more prone to illness.

To avoid feelings of overwhelm due to sleep deprivation, it’s important to prioritize getting enough restful sleep each night, establishing healthy sleep habits and routines, and seeking help if chronic sleep problems persist.

Stick to a consistent sleep schedule:Plan to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on the weekends.

Create a bedtime routine:Establish a relaxing pre-sleep routine to signal to your body that it’s time to sleep, such as taking a warm bath, reading, or meditating.

Make your sleep environment comfortable:Create a sleep-conducive environment, such as keeping the bedroom dark, quiet, and cool.

Reduce and limit screen time before bed:The blue light emitted by electronic devices can significantly disrupt sleep, so limiting their use before bedtime is best.

Exercise regularly:Regular exercise improves sleep quality and can help you fall asleep more easily.

Avoid caffeine and alcohol:Both can interfere with sleep, so it’s a good idea to avoid or, at the very least, limit them, especially in the hours before bedtime.

Manage stress:Stress and anxiety can severely interfere with sleep, so it’s important to find ways to manage stress, like practicing relaxation techniques or seeking therapy.

Avoid large meals before bed:Eating a heavy meal before bedtime can interfere with sleep and cause discomfort, so eating a lighter meal earlier in the evening is best.

Consider sleep aids as a last resort:If sleep problems persist, consult with a healthcare provider about the appropriate use of sleep aids, as they should only be used as a last resort and under the guidance of a professional.

Avoid napping during the day:Having a nap can create problems with nighttime sleep, so it’s best to avoid naps or limit them to 30 minutes.

Feeling overwhelmed is a common experience, and it can be challenging to know how to manage it.

However, with the proper tools and strategies, navigating these feelings and coming out the other side is easier.

Whether it’s practicing self-care, seeking support from loved ones or professionals, or making lifestyle changes, there are many ways to tackle overwhelm and regain a sense of balance and control.

Remind yourself it’s okay to ask for help, slow down, and take things one step at a time. Then, with patience, perseverance, and a willingness to try new approaches, you can overcome overwhelm and find peace and fulfillment in your life.

Transcript:
(00:00) hey y'all welcome to my channel for those who don't know me my name is Mel for those who do know me welcome back I'm going to be talking about why you get so overwhelmed all the time while you get overwhelmed so easily um I'll be talking about if it's normal for you to be overwhelmed all the time just break down break it down break down the overwhelming feeling that so many people feel today first I want to answer the question if it's normal for you to feel overwhelmed all the time it's absolutely not normal
(00:30) it's definitely common in society today because Society Praises like hard work Society Praises just being in this highly stressful State all the time and not having enough time to complete the things that you need to complete um Society has this like Grand this grind culture like I always hear people say I'll sleep when I die or like they praise their work ethic because they work so hard Even in our our songs and stuff like that like this is all we hear this is all we hear is always see so you likely think that it's normal for
(01:09) you to feel overwhelmed all the time but it's not it's not normal feeling overwhelmed all the time leads to a bunch of other issues that you will develop in the future if you're not experiencing them now the reason why you feel so overwhelmed all the time is because our culture our society Praises this hard work and so you think like you develop these these beliefs that you have to sacrifice your time or you got to sacrifice your health you got to sacrifice something for the grind and if you're not working hard then in
(01:43) other words you're not worthy if you just you know not a hard worker you're not worth anything people who feel this way right and people who live with this belief which is most most of us today or most people in society today because that's all we see that's all we hear so we think it's a normal natural thing to be just like highly stressed and overwhelmed and exhausted all the time and once this once you have this belief once you form this belief it gets ingrained and your mind and so your work ethic or
(02:15) how much you can do how much you can give what you can give how often you give like all that is tied to your sense of worth it's like everyone who feels like they need to work hard or who feels like they got to be overwhelmed they got to be exhausted they got to do everything for everybody else take care of everything and everybody else but themselves they don't feel worthy inside like you don't feel worthy inside so you try to make up for it you try to prove your worth by working hard by trying to prove
(02:49) that you can um take on all these tasks at your job by trying to prove that you can take care of everybody save everything everybody else and you end up over booking a schedule you end up overbooking your calendar and you just left like feeling bad you left feeling drained you left feeling emotionally exhausted physically exhausted feeling like there's nothing left for you and this sense of overwhelm like it really it's just this feeling in your in your brain like you're like your head is about to
(03:23) pop off or something because it's just being loaded up with all this stuff just load it up with stuff load it up with unnecessary stuff so when you carry that belief that you need to like sacrifice something for the grime in detail you feeling like you're not worthy you're going to continue you're going to continue to work work or think that you got to work work work to prove your worth since it's ingrained in your unconscious mind and you got this subconscious belief that your worth is tied to how much you
(03:57) can do for other people or how much you could do for your job how much you could do for your family your kids um if you have like family members or friends who always reach out to you for stuff and it's just like I don't have anything left like I don't have nothing left for myself of course you're gonna feel overwhelmed of course you're gonna feel stressed you're not gonna have energy to do the things that you really want to do in your life so if you like want to work out if you want to eat
(04:23) right if you want to develop certain healthy coping habits or healthy habits in general and you overwhelmed all the time you're not going to be able to you're not gonna be able to juggle all that so you really got to challenge like what is most important to me it has to be some balance you can't just give everything you can't give yourself physically you can't give yourself emotionally you can't give yourself financially you can't just give give give and not expect to feel overwhelmed
(04:57) especially if you're not recharging you're not pouring back into yourself if you don't get to a point where you feel like you're worthy if you stay stuck in this belief that you gotta sacrifice something for the grind if you stay stuck in this belief that it's normal for you to be overwhelmed or like it's just the normal part of living in society today [Music] nah no don't accept that don't let nobody tell you that you have to be overworked overwhelmed you have to be exhausted you have to be tired because
(05:32) in the end it's not worth it it's definitely not worth it you overwhelmed all the time and you always in this highly stressful State that's when you start to to develop different illnesses you start to develop chronic illnesses you develop anxiety you develop depression you develop physical issues that affect every single system in your body so being overwhelmed all the time is stressful right so being overwhelmed all the time feeling that stress all the time it's Gonna Make You overthink it's gonna make
(06:08) you anxious it's going to make you depressed it's gonna make you feel Dream It's Gonna Make You have zero energy and when you keep yourself in that state especially long term a lot of people when they're in the state they just suck it up they hold it in they don't say nothing but they're just struggling like internally secretly trying to save everybody else and when you do that and you just hold everything in and you don't find a way to take care of you you don't find a way to not be overwhelmed that's
(06:40) going to catch up with you if you're not feeling anything now you're gonna feel it in the future that is a given like that's a guarantee because the longer you put your body through something the longer you put your mind through something that's going to show up it's all adding up and it's going to be a sum total of it's going to be a total it's going to be a an accumulation it's going to be an accumulation of all these feelings of overwhelm all these feelings of stressed when you feel these negative
(07:16) emotions they got to find a way to to release they got to find a way to get out so that's when you start developing physical ailments you start getting headaches your memories affected your judgment is affected you can't focus your productivity is affected and on top of that top of that is placing you at risk for heart for heart attacks Strokes heart disease high blood pressure is placing my wrist for stomach issues nausea vomiting diarrhea IBS body aches pain there's so many people who have pain a lot of that pain
(07:58) is secondary to stress is secondary to anxiety you being overwhelmed all the time it affects your sexual drive it literally affects everything affects your sleep so listen being overwhelmed all the time just to reiterate it's not a normal thing it's not normal it don't got to be a reality and if you keep carrying that belief that you got to sacrifice something if you keep carrying that belief that being overwhelmed is normal if you keep carrying that deep belief that you're not good enough so you gotta like work
(08:34) to compensate or to make up for that you're gonna keep falling into that that overwhelmed stuck feeling and that feeling like your brain is just like it's just like a tornado of things that you got to do that you got to get done and it's just like never it's never ending you won't be able to get through that tornado you won't be able to be the calm and the storm you won't be able to break free from that overwhelm from all that heightened stress and all that until those inside things are fixed until your
(09:11) beliefs are fixed until any emotions that you fill in that you're not dealing with like those things got to be taken care of and it's not that you're just overwhelmed like you're overwhelmed because of the way your brain is set up your brain is responding to stress at this heightened level your brain is just always on go it's always on alert thinking that something's going to pop off thinking that you are under a threat of course you won't feel overwhelmed your brain is literally working overtime
(09:45) your brain and your body is working overtime when you feel overwhelmed all the time this definitely has a negative impact on your mental health your physical health and your financial health because now you're trying to buy things to to feel calm when you're trying to buy stuff to make you feel better or to make you feel good A lot of people resort to retail therapy people smoke drink smoke weed smoke cigarettes drink alcohol self-medicate and as long as you continue to do these things without fixing the real reason
(10:22) why you get so overwhelmed in the first place without fixing with internal you don't continue to attract the overwhelm so the more you feel negative emotions the more you feel negative emotions because your negative emotions literally become a practice habit so if you think negative 95 of the time your brain's going to keep giving you back that negativity when you think negative thoughts you feel overwhelmed and it's just this cycle of overwhelm and just negativity and overthinking everything and you you're stuck in this cycle

Why you are so overwhelmed in your new job or role. - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToVaPg1AP6w

Transcript:
(00:01) so you are in a new job or possibly you're just in a new role maybe you've been promoted maybe you've shifted roles in your company maybe you've left one company and you're in a totally different job it could even be a completely different career shift and you are experiencing overwhelm there's a few things that I want to say about this first of all there is a level of overwhelm and anxiety that's to be expected when we make any kind of change in our life so your mind wants things to
(00:28) be consistent it wants things to be calm it wants things to be very familiar so anytime we make any kind of change the mine has a bit of a temper tantrum and it starts to freak out about all the things that needs to learn the new environment a feeling of not being an expert anymore all of that is a really natural part of having any kind of transition in our career what's important is that you pay attention to the extent to which you're experiencing this so a lot of people sort of feel that angst when they make a change but
(00:59) there is a certain sector of the population women that I work with in particular and it's a fairly large sector that struggle with an underlying issue of imposter syndrome fear of failing chronic comparision fear of making mistakes people who are very ambitious really can have this buried under the surface and what happens is when you make a change and all of a sudden you're in something that's unfamiliar you're in a position that feels a little bit more vulnerable because suddenly you have to learn a lot
(01:33) and you have to put yourself out there in a different way the impostor syndrome monsters will sort of come out of the closet and show up in your new job or your new career if you are noticing that you are frequently questioning am i competent enough to do this am i capable enough did I make a mistake people are gonna figure out that I don't really know what I'm doing what if IIF this whole thing up what if I fail at this what if I make a mistake in it's catastrophic what if people judge me you're
(02:05) experiencing a level that is a little bit deeper than just the sort of norm transition pains that come with any kind of job change so what you're experiencing is you're probably hidden impostor syndrome that you've had for most of your career but you've been able to manage it and deal with it because you became sort of an expert or familiar where you were and now that you've made a change all of those things have come back to the surface so it's really important that you first start by
(02:33) understanding that you are a person that has this because if you don't understand that you will take it to be an objective perspective on your experience so if you are someone that suffers from impostor syndrome and if you're still tuned in to this video then chances are you do if all the questions that I just put in front of you you said yes yes and yes then you do the tricky thing is you tend to think you have an objective evaluation of your competency your abilities and your reality in this new position role job so when you're moving
(03:07) throughout your day and you're thinking crap I made a mistake or you're thinking I don't really know what I'm doing or they're gonna figure me out or I'm never gonna fit in here or I should know more than I already do you think you're having some sort of really helpful and objective dialogue in your head about what's going on but what you're actually having is a miscalculation of what's actually happening so your ability to evaluate your own competency your own abilities is off your barometer is off
(03:36) because you have this underlying imposter syndrome where you always tend to underestimate your abilities your competency and you tend to think that other people's perception of you is far more negative than it actually is so the first thing I want you to do is to recognize that this is what's going on if you are really identifying with what I'm talking to you about because what you have is an inability to accurately look at this role to an inability to accurately determine if this is a good fit for you how to sort
(04:09) of mesh into this culture and you've also got something that's really gonna cause you a lot more suffering during this transition because it's going to bring up all of those fears of failure your perfectionism your comparison all sort of monsters are spinning like crazy so I want you to just start by recognizing that you have it because a lot of times that can help to start making your perception of things shift a little too oh gosh maybe this temper tantrum isn't actually an accurate perception of what's going on I'm inside
(04:37) my head too much and what I don't want you to do is to self-sabotage in your new position so start by recognizing my barometer for evaluating my own competency and my own abilities is off and my barometer for evaluating how other people perceive my performance is also off because just this little tweak will help you to start realizing that what's happening in your brain is not actually an objective reality in terms of what's actually going on in this new position for you so please feel free to check out the other resources below here
(05:11) that are here to help you specifically with this phenomenon with this transition with this new job with your confidence level with your feelings of competency and I also really encourage you to look at my one on one program where I look specifically at getting you out of this state of panic uncertainty and second-guessing so that you can start really feeling confident kick-ass in your new role working to your potential and so that you can get a very clear evaluation of how this new role fits for you how to utilize it if you
(05:44) need to make a change or not so I encourage you below I have the link check out my one on one coaching program I offer a free consultation in there you can hop on a call let me know what's going on with you and I can tell you if this program is a good fit for you thanks so much for tuning in
















"Can you help me sleep better?”

You're not doomed to toss and turn every night. Consider simple tips for better sleep, from setting a sleep schedule to including physical activity in your daily routine.

Many factors can interfere with a good night's sleep — from work stress and family responsibilities to illnesses. It's no wonder that quality sleep is sometimes elusive.

You might not be able to control the factors that interfere with your sleep. However, you can adopt habits that encourage better sleep. Start with these simple tips.

Set aside no more than eight hours for sleep. The recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult is at least seven hours. Most people don't need more than eight hours in bed to be well rested.

Go to bed and get up at the same time every day, including weekends. Being consistent reinforces your body's sleep-wake cycle.

If you don't fall asleep within about 20 minutes of going to bed, leave your bedroom and do something relaxing. Read or listen to soothing music. Go back to bed when you're tired. Repeat as needed, but continue to maintain your sleep schedule and wake-up time.

Don't go to bed hungry or stuffed. In particular, avoid heavy or large meals within a couple of hours of bedtime. Discomfort might keep you up.

Nicotine, caffeine and alcohol deserve caution, too. The stimulating effects of nicotine and caffeine take hours to wear off and can interfere with sleep. And even though alcohol might make you feel sleepy at first, it can disrupt sleep later in the night.

Keep your room cool, dark and quiet. Exposure to light in the evenings might make it more challenging to fall asleep. Avoid prolonged use of light-emitting screens just before bedtime. Consider using room-darkening shades, earplugs, a fan or other devices to create an environment that suits your needs.

Doing calming activities before bedtime, such as taking a bath or using relaxation techniques, might promote better sleep.

Long daytime naps can interfere with nighttime sleep. Limit naps to no more than one hour and avoid napping late in the day.

However, if you work nights, you might need to nap late in the day before work to help make up your sleep debt.

Regular physical activity can promote better sleep. However, avoid being active too close to bedtime.

Spending time outside every day might be helpful, too.

Try to resolve your worries or concerns before bedtime. Jot down what's on your mind and then set it aside for tomorrow.

Stress management might help. Start with the basics, such as getting organized, setting priorities and delegating tasks. Meditation also can ease anxiety.

Nearly everyone has an occasional sleepless night. However, if you often have trouble sleeping, contact your health care provider. Identifying and treating any underlying causes can help you get the better sleep you deserve.

Virend Somers, M.D., Ph.D.:When you don't sleep well, bad things happen.

Vivien Williams:Dr. Virend Somers is a cardiologist who studies sleep.

Dr. Somers:Sleep is very much a multidisciplinary specialty for good reason because sleep affects all the organs of the body.

Vivien Williams:Poor sleep may increase your risk of conditions such as heart disease, obesity, depression, dementia. And it even affects how you look. Dr. Somers offers the following tips: Avoid alcohol and big meals before bed; don't exercise right before bed; and turn off all screens, including your smartphone, an hour before bed.

Dr. Somers:We've got bright lights all over the place, and then we switch the lights off, we lie in bed and expect to sleep. The bedroom, the bed is for sex and sleep. It's not for spreadsheets, it's not for watching TV.

Vivien Williams:He also suggests keeping your bedroom as dark and quiet as possible. Healthy sleep for a healthy life. For the Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Vivien Williams.

Making changes to your diet and lifestyle may help improve your sleep quality. Certain supplements and natural remedies could also be beneficial.

A good night’s sleep is just as important for your health as regular exercise and a healthy diet.

Researchshows that poor sleep can have a negative effect on your thinking ability, mood, heart health, immune health, and more. It can also increase your chances of developing obesity and diabetes, among other health conditions.

For this reason, getting a good night’s sleep is one of the most important things you can do to optimize your health.

Here are 15 evidence-based tips to help you sleep better at night.

Spending time in natural sunlight or bright light during the daycan helpkeep yourcircadian rhythmhealthy and, in turn, improve your daytimeenergyand nighttime sleep quality and duration.

The results of asmall 2022 studysuggest thatdaytime bright light exposurecan improve sleep quality and duration. For this reason, it’s a good idea to get daily sunlight exposure or, if that’s not possible for you, to invest in an artificial bright light device or bulbs.

An earlier2017 studyof more than 100 office workers found that those who were exposed to a lot of light in the morning had less time to fall asleep at night, especially in winter. They also found better synchronization of the body’s internal clock and an improved quality of sleep.

Nighttime light exposure can have the opposite effect from daytime exposure because it reduces your levels of some hormones —including melatonin, which helps you relax and get deep sleep.

Blue light, which electronic devices like smartphones and computers give off in large amounts, is the worst type in this regard.

There are several popular methods you can use to reduce nighttimeblue light exposure. These include wearingglasses that block blue lightand turning off the TV, other devices, and any bright lights 2 hours before bed.

A single dose ofcaffeinecan enhance focus, energy, and sports performance. However, the authors of a2023 research reviewfound that late caffeine consumption reduced total sleep time by 45 minutes and overall sleep efficiency by 7%.

This may be because caffeine may have anegative effectonREM sleep, though the research on daytime caffeine consumption and sleepisn’t conclusive.

To be safe, it’s a good idea to avoid drinking caffeinated beverages at least8 hoursbefore bedtime. And if you’re taking a caffeine supplement, don’t take it within 13 hours of bedtime.

If you find yourself craving a cup of coffee in the late afternoon or evening, stick withdecaffeinatedcoffee.

While short power naps can be beneficial, taking long or irregular naps during the day can negatively affect your nighttime sleep.

Sleeping in the daytime can confuse your internal clock, meaning that youmay have a hard timefalling asleep at night.

But the effects of napping vary from person to person. For example, a2021 reviewsuggests that napping might be helpful for people who are athletes or engage in strenuous physical activity and might not compromise their nighttime sleep quality.

If you take regular daytime naps and sleep well, you shouldn’t worry. But if they seem to be disrupting your nighttime sleep, consider cutting them shorter or limiting them.

Your body’s circadian rhythm functions on a set loop, aligning itself with sunrise and sunset. That’s why being consistent with your sleep and waking times can aid long-term sleep quality.

A2020 reviewof 41 studies found that going to bed late or having an irregular sleep pattern negatively affected sleep quality.

If you have trouble sleeping, try to get into the habit of waking up and going to bed at similar times every day. After several weeks, you might not even need an alarm.

Melatoninis a key sleep hormone that tells your brain when it’s time to relax and head to bed. Melatonin supplements are an extremelypopular sleep aidandmay help youfall asleep faster.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t classify melatonin as a drug, which means that, as with other supplements, the FDA does not regulate its quality or dosage. However, research studies have looked at doses of 0.1 to 10 milligrams (mg) up to 2 hours before bedtime.

You can start with a low dose and work your way up. But before trying melatonin supplements, it’s a good idea to check with a healthcare professional. Always talk with a healthcare professional if you’re thinking about using melatonin as a sleep aid foryour child. Long-term use of this supplement in childrenhas not been well studied.

Several supplements may help you relax and go to sleep,including:

While these supplements are not a magic bullet for sleep issues, they can be useful when combined with other strategies. Make sure to try these supplements one at a time to test their effects on your sleep and to make sure you don’t have a negative reaction.

Having a couple of drinks at night can negatively affect your sleep and hormone levels.

This is becausealcoholis known tocause or increasethe symptoms of sleep apnea, snoring, and disrupted sleep patterns. It also changes nighttime melatonin production, which plays a key role in your body’s circadian rhythm.

While an occasional drink at dinner or when you’re out in the evening isn’t likely to be harmful, consider avoiding drinking alcohol too close to bedtime on most nights.

Learn more:How much alcohol is too much?

Bed quality can also affect sleep. For example, poor-quality bedding can lead to increasedlower back pain, which can make it harder to sleep well.

According to a2021 research review, medium-firm mattresses may be a good choice for comfort and to avoid back pain. However, thebest mattressand bedding for you are extremely subjective. If you’re upgrading your bedding, base your choice on personal preference.

In a2024 review, researchers examined nine studies on sleep quality involving various bedding and sleepwear materials, including cotton, polyester, wool, duck down, goose down, polyester, linen, and a blend of cotton and polyester.

Different materials were found to improve sleep in varying conditions. For example, wool appeared to help adults fall asleep in cool temperatures, while linen appeared to improve sleep quality for young adults in warm temperatures. Goose down was also found to increase slow-wave sleep for young adults in cooler environments.

So, if you haven’t replaced your mattress or bedding for several years, doing so can be a quick — but possibly expensive — fix.

Your bedroom environment isn’t just about how comfortable your bed or bedding is. It’s also important to considertemperature,noiselevel,ventilation, and even the level of allergens orcarbon dioxidein the air.

To optimize your bedroom environment, try to minimize external noise, light, and artificial lights from devices such as alarm clocks.

Also, if possible, keep your bedroom at acomfortable temperature. Around 65°F (18.3°C) seems to be a comfortable temperature for most people, although it depends on your preferences and habits. It might also be a good idea to work onimproving your home’s air quality.

Eating late at night maynegatively affectsleep quality. Consider eating dinner at least a few hours before you go to bed. If you do choose to eat later, limit consumption to a small snack.

The quality and type of food in yourlate night snackmight also play a role in your sleep. For example, high carb foodhas been foundto have a worse effect on sleep than low carb food.

Learn more:

“Nocturia” is the medical term for excessive urination during the night. Itcan negatively affectboth sleep quality and daytime energy.

Drinking large amounts of liquids before bed can lead to similar symptoms, though some people are more sensitive than others.

Although hydration isvital for your health, it’s wise to reduce your fluid intake late in the evening.

As with food, try not to drink any fluids for 1–2 hours before going to bed.

You should also use the bathroom right before going to bed, as this may decrease your chances of waking up at night.

Learn more:Drinking water before bed.

Practicing relaxation techniques before bed has been shown to improve sleep quality. These techniques are also a common method used to treat insomnia. Examples includemindfulness, meditation, and evenlistening to music.

You could also try reading a book, taking a hot bath,deep breathing, orvisualization. Try out different methods to find what works best for you.

Learn more:How to fall asleep in 10, 60, or 120 secondsand3 ways to meditate for better sleep.

An underlying health condition may be the cause of your sleep problems.

One common issue issleep apnea. A 2023 review suggests that about33.9% of men and 17.4% of womenin the United States have sleep apnea.

Other sleep disorders include:

You might also experienceinsomnia, which can be caused by factors such as stress and underlying medical conditions. According to a 2020 research review, at least10%of adults have chronic insomnia, and 20% experience it occasionally.

If you’ve always had trouble sleeping, it might be a good idea to consult a healthcare professional.

Getting regular physical exercisecan helpimprove sleep and health.

It can enhance all aspects of sleep andhas been usedto reduce symptoms of insomnia.

Although daily exercise is key for a good night’s sleep, exercising too late in the daymay causesleep problems.

This is due to the stimulatory effect of exercise, which increases alertness and levels of hormones such as epinephrine and adrenaline. However, this can also depend on the individual.

The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend getting150 minutesof exercise per week. If you spread this throughout the week and make sure to leave a few hours between your workout and bedtime, you may notice a positive effect on your sleep quality.

This is onestrategy for better sleep. Starting 10 hours before bedtime, avoid consuming caffeine. Three hours before bed, limit alcohol and food. Two hours before bed, try to relax and avoid mentally taxing tasks. One hour before bed put away all your electronics.

There are many strategies you can try to help yourself learn to sleep better. For starters, it can be helpful to establish a sleep routine. Then, you can work on making your environment more conducive to sleep, reducing light and noise close to bedtime, and limiting the foods and drinks you consume before you go to bed.

Help Me With... Sleep Trouble and Anxiety! - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) - Can you help me sleep better, please? Hey guys, Howard Cooper here. And today I want to share with you some stuff that often comes up in my clinic when I'm seeing clients one-on-one. They come in and they say, "Howard, can you help me sleep better, please?" Because sleep has become a big issue for them.
(00:18) And this is particularly true when people struggle with anxiety as well and often find themselves trying to sleep at a ruminating or get to sleep easily, but then wake up at night. So I want to share with you a bunch of thoughts that may really help. And by the way, they probably won't be what you think.
(00:35) (upbeat music) People come to see me and they say things like, "You know I've been to see the sleep experts and I've read all about what I should be doing and it's not working. What are you going to tell me that is different from all of that? Well, I'm gonna be honest with you. And maybe this will ruffle some feathers, but I am not a big fan of what the sleep experts supposedly say about getting a good night's sleep.
(01:07) Apparently you should use your bed only for lovemaking and for sleep. Okay, all alright. What else, what else you got sleep experts? No screen time for like two or three hours before going to bed. And they talk about the chemicals that are created with the harsh light that stimulates the brain to make it more awake and that's what you want to avoid so you shouldn't be doing that.
(01:30) Have a nice bath before bedtime because as you come out, your body temperature drops it can help you go into a nice, comfortable sleep. Dim the lights in a particular way so that, you know my body is stimulated into relaxation mode and calmness for at least an hour before I even attempt to go to sleep. Take up yoga, do meditation.
(01:51) Here's the problem. I have seen people who have been so sleep "experted" to death. That they now approach bedtime and they have, I mean they're already struggling with anxiety and now what they've got, it's a whole list of 1,000,001 things that they have to do perfectly and correctly in order to be able to ensure that they have a night's sleep and the chances of them doing all of these things are nigh impossible.
(02:15) Oh no, shit I accidentally looked at a screen. It was within 50 minutes of going to bed. Now it's going to ruin my sleep. Instead of making them more relaxed and then just allowing themselves to have the experience of sleep. I've seen people become really concerned with sleep routines and following expert advice in order to ensure that it's perfect.
(02:40) Otherwise, how else would we sleep? But I think it's important to take a step back and to start looking at this a little differently. And I don't buy into any of that stuff. And quite frankly to me, it's nonsense. Well, I say it's nonsense. I think they're coming from a different angle.
(02:58) Let me explain the sleep experts job is often to study sleep and to find the optimal conditions chemically looking at what can we do to trigger sleep in our brains and how can we slow our system down so that we can sleep easily? So it would make sense, would it not? If we're struggling to sleep to go and look at this information.
(03:21) But here's the thing, before people had these sleep issues, most of us have had periods in our life maybe when we were young, where we weren't doing any of those things that the sleep experts were saying and we were sleeping, we were sleeping just fine. Because it hadn't even struck us as sleeping would be difficult or sleeping would be tough.
(03:40) If you stop and think about it, sleeping is one of those things we are born doing easily. Going to sleep is the easiest thing that we've ever done. We just know how to do it. And then all that happens is we have a few nights about where we doing anxiety. And then we get this little germ of an idea, don't we? The germ of an idea goes something along the lines of, "Oh shit, maybe I've got a sleep issue.
(04:03) " And then the next day we start going, "What if tonight I'm lying in bed and awake "and I can't sleep and maybe it's a problem. "And maybe, and maybe, and Oh God, what" And then we get really absorbed into that story. And if we get too absorbed into the story of I have a sleep issue, then we start to get tense and anxious and we start looking for all of the solutions that I must need to do in order to be able to sleep effectively or to get some sleep.
(04:32) So well in that case I must have the bath and drink the cocoa. And if you get them really absorbed in that story that you begin to take it as real. And you don't just see it as, "No, no these are just thoughts about I'm not gonna sleep." Then your body begins to create that, and you get tense.
(04:51) And guess what happens when you get tense, it's harder to relax. Anything that gives you more tension around the whole sleep issue, ultimately doesn't work effectively, right? So when the sleep experts say you've got a whole list of stuff you gotta do in order to sleep effectively that becomes a whole tension around, "I like don't follow the instructions correctly, will this work? Won't it work? What if I don't? That in and of itself causes you to go inside and create more tension.
(05:20) Now I'm not suggesting that the sleep experts have no merit. What I'm saying is their job is to look at best practise of like, what are the conditions to create the perfect night's sleep chemically in an ideal world. But if you going from troubled sleeping and you're not sleeping at all and your leap is, "I want to go from not sleeping and having problem sleeping to gold standard sleep experience every single night without fail.
(05:47) It might be too unachievable and set you up for failure. Give you a good example, someone came to see me who was having terrible sleep issues and they said they can't sleep. They can't sleep, they can't sleep. They're lie in bed, tossing, turning, tossing, turning. And then they end up going downstairs, turn the TV on, watching TV and they fall asleep in front of the TV.
(06:07) I said, well, why don't you just get a TV in your room and watch it in bed and fall asleep there? "Oh, no" they went. I mean they were just shocked abhorrently. "Can't do that." I was like, "Well, why not?" We'll because the sleep experts tell me I shouldn't have watched TV in my room, it's bad for sleep.
(06:31) Okay, but here's the thing, when they're watching TV at four in the morning they stopped paying attention to that story of I can't sleep. They get out of their own head in such a way that their body naturally just takes over. So why not use that? Stick a TV in the room and watch it. If that gives you focus outside of yourself so that it helps not to get too caught up in those stories of, "You know, I'm not gonna be able "to sleep and I have sleep issues" then fine, go ahead and do that for a time.
(07:03) And if that helps you get to sleep, do it. And okay, if you want to work at some point in the future towards gold standard best sleep practise as recommended by sleep experts, then do that, that's fine. But do it from a place of getting some rest, right? You know, like if watching the TV screen helps you somewhat, not ideal, but at least you're getting some sleep.
(07:24) So my view is a very pragmatic one. It's all about taking away and removing psychological pressure. Because when you stop putting yourself under such pressure to have certain experiences, the whole thing gets easier. There's a great book by Matthew Syed called bounce. Matthew Syed's an ex table tennis champion.
(07:45) And he talks about, I think I may be misquoting this, correct me if I'm wrong in the comments, he talks about being a final of a big event, world championship or whatever coming up, and he totally choked. And choking in the sports context is where you play really well but then a match or an event comes up that really matters and they go inside and they say to themselves, "I have to play well.
(08:10) "This is so important. "This is the moment that matters." And that internal demand of this is the moment that really matters creates so much pressure in the system. They're reduced to playing like rank amateurs. No shots get back, they can't. And he talks really eloquently about this idea of being in a flow state when you're doing performance or sports.
(08:37) The same I think is trend of sleeping. Sleeping is one of those things that when you were born, you do effortlessly and easily. Then all what happens is you begin to overthink the whole process. And now it gets hard. Who's had the experience where maybe you're having a patch where you're sleeping fine and sleep's easy.
(08:57) But then you have a big event coming up the next day an exam or something important or something you have to get up early for. And what do you do, you say to yourself, "I have to go to bed early "because I have to have a good night's sleep. "I have to, I must." And the moment you start saying to yourself, "I have to get some sleep and I must get some sleep.
(09:17) " And you feel like in total pressure to do it, how many times do you ever have struggle to sleep that night? Why? Because you made the stakes too high. This demand of I have to get some sleep immediately so that I can have this energy the next day. That becomes the thing that keeps you awake. You're inside now trying to go, "Okay, I've got to sleep, I've got to sleep, "I've got to sleep, come on, come on.
(09:41) " (groans) Kind of reminds me of a guy who came to see me. And this guy was like everything he'd ever achieved in his life was through sheer force of will. He told me proudly, he was the CEO of a big organisation, he'd made it happen. And he was used to getting his own way and he was used to making things happen through force of will.
(10:02) And he was really intense. Had this kind of strange tense glare at me and I said, "Listen, maybe we should start "with some relaxation." And he went, "Oh yeah, I'm going to be the best at relaxing "out of everyone that you've ever seen relaxed before. "Watch this.
(10:20) " (groans) And he couldn't do it. Because there are some things you can't do through force of will. Going to sleep is one of those things. Sleep happens just unfolds. But if you're demanding or doing things where you're saying I have to get some sleep tonight, and I have to stick to my list of prescribed sleep expert advice in order to do it, and I must do it perfectly.
(10:50) Then you're likely to be approaching the whole thing from a place of tension, which is going to get in the way. So I'm gonna suggest some things to you that may challenge your thinking a little bit. And I invite you to be open. From the perspective of if all the stuff that you've been doing hasn't been working which led you to click on this video to find out what this was all about, then perhaps the stuff that you have been doing is not where the solution lies.
(11:17) And maybe this could help thinking differently. I'd like you to do an exercise right now. This is an exercise I've done a few times on my YouTube channel, but I'd like to do it right now in this context which is close your eyes, and just say to yourself in your mind, "I have to relax right now.
(11:35) " In your mind, "I have to relax right now." And notice how that feels. And now instead, say to yourself, "I'd like to relax, I'd like to relax." What's the difference in feeling when you do that? Now I've done this a lot with people over the years and often people say, "Well when I said I have to relax "right now, there's a demand, my body gets more tense.
(12:04) "It's harder to relax. "Whereas when I say, I'd like to relax, it's just more "a case of, well, I'd like it to happen. "It kind of feels easier." The difference is, is that when you say, "I'd like to relax... I have a preference to relax." There's also an acceptance deep down that you don't have to.
(12:24) It's not something that's mandatory. It doesn't have to be a certain way. Which means there's no internal pressure. Makes it more likely to happen. Now, one of the things that I would get you to challenge if you have anxiety and you have trouble sleeping, is really challenge (indistinct) do you have to sleep? Do you have to get some sleep now? Okay, Right.
(12:48) I know there's going to be resistance. I can feel it already. You're probably going, "Of course, don't be silly. "We humans have to sleep." But let's just narrow the scope for a moment. I'm not talking about for the rest of your life, I'm talking about just tonight. Do you have to get some sleep.
(13:03) Now again there's likely to be some resistance. You're gonna be going, "Well yeah 'cause I'll be tired tomorrow." Well, hold on a moment. Is that actually a universal law that says you mustn't be tired tomorrow? No, it's not like gravity. You know, regardless of whether I want gravity to exist or not, it just exists.
(13:25) There's nothing I can do about it. Well, it is possible for humans to be tired tomorrow. It's possible. And if you're saying I mustn't be tired, I have to be awake tomorrow, I have to be fully alert, then a bit like the exercise with say to yourself "I'd like to relax or I must relax.
(13:46) " If you're saying to yourself, "I have to be awake tomorrow," you're implying that there's no other alternative, that it's not humanly possible to be tired. And it is humanly possible. I know you'd like to be awake, but guess what if you think of it as, "Well I'd like to have energy tomorrow, "rather than I have to" then you're accepting that it doesn't have to be a certain way.
(14:12) Likely it helps. likely the pressure is alleviated. It makes it more likely to happen. The moment you're willing to look inside and go, "Okay, I know I'd like to sleep, but no. "I don't have to. "I'm willing not to. Now I know that you'd like to sleep. I get that, that's a deep preference.
(14:36) What I really want for you is to challenge, does it have to be? Is there a universal law that says you have to sleep? All humans have to sleep every night. If you can let go of these internal demands that you have to then it likely leads you to a place where you're much more grounded and it's much more likely to happen.
(14:58) Essentially you get out of your own way. This is one of the biggest pieces that can make the biggest difference in terms of your sleep patterns. If you can begin to challenge that demand that you have to sleep, you're likely to be able to get to sleep much more effectively. As always I hope this has been useful and there'll be future stuff on sleep related issues and some practical strategies too, but this is one of the biggest pieces that again, if you can get your head around, it's gonna make
(15:25) one of the biggest differences. If you wanna throw us a like, that would be great. If you wanna share this content or comment on it, let me know how you're getting on. Your engagement really helps YouTube know that this is content worth putting out far and wide. So, really appreciate you tuning in. Any questions Let me know.

It’s not uncommon for students who learn and think differently to alsostruggle with anxiety. They might worry a lot or be withdrawn at school. They may hesitate to participate in the classroom, make frequent trips to the bathroom or the nurse’s office, or even refuse to go to school at all. All of this can get in the way of learning.

Here are some of the supports teachers can use to help students who struggle with anxiety. You can also download and print a list of these accommodations.

Classroom accommodations for anxietyPDF-151.1 KB

Encourage the student to use self-calming or anxiety-reducing techniques that a counselor or therapist taught them.

Allow the student to have a self-calming object or family pictures on hand.

Check in frequently for understanding and “emotional temperature.”

Build in “call home” breaks (for students with separation anxiety).

Let the student seek help from a designated staff member with mental health expertise when feeling anxious.

Clearly state and/or write down classroom expectations and consequences.

Allow the student to sit where they’re most comfortable, like near a teacher or a friend.

Let the student sit near the back of the room or by an exit during assemblies.

Provide a “take a break” pass to let the student walk down the hallway, get a drink, or leave the classroom when needed.

Assign the student a designated buddy for lunchtime, recess, and/or hallways.

Allow preferential grouping for field trips so the student is with a teacher or friends.

Create a plan for catching up after an absence or illness (for example, excusing missed homework or having a known time frame for making up work).

Give advance notice of planned substitute teachers, changes in routine, or transitions.

Rehearse transitions in a private or low-stress environment.

Provide a signal before calling on the student and a signal for the student to opt out of answering.

Break down assignments into smaller chunks.

Use both oral and written instructions.

Exempt the student from reading aloud or demonstrating work in front of the class.

Let the student present projects to the teacher instead of to the entire class.

Give extended time on tests and/or separate test-taking space to reduce performance anxiety.

Allow word banks, notes, and fact cards for tests (for students who freeze or “go blank” during in-class tests).

Set time limits for homework or reduce the amount of homework.

Assure that work not completed in that time won’t count against the student.

Provide class notes via email or a school portal for the student to preview.

Give notice of upcoming tests (no “pop quizzes”).

When a student is being treated for anxiety, people who work with them at school should be in contact with the student’s mental health care provider. You can talk about strategies and make sure the accommodations are a good fit.

Inspiration to your inbox

Struggling with social anxiety? Looking for a way to take the edge off normal social interactions? You’ll find thousands of tips, tricks, and techniques to sort through on the worldwide web, all promising a quick fix to the anxieties that plague you. But if you want real results, you’ll want to start with those which have been thoroughly researched, explored, and found worthwhile by professionals.

To make it easier to start improving your condition, we’re focusing today on those techniques and tactics you can implement on your own, without much or any outside help. Professional counseling and/or medication can of course prove very valuable in dealing with anxiety and other behavioral health problems. The following, however, are techniques you can begin implementing immediately.

Exercise is often the first recommendationfor improving your life. You’ll receive this advice from any doctor, therapist, psychiatrist, or life coach for one reason: it works. While the exact level of improvement you see by treating anxiety with exercise will vary, depending on the type of anxiety you face, you’ll almost certainly see some level of improvement.

Most studies focused onmental healthhave noted improvements primarily from aerobic exercise, such as running, biking, swimming, dancing, gardening, etc. While you’ll likely see benefits from anaerobic exercise such as weight lifting, sprinting, and other intense physical activity, your best choices are traditional aerobic exercises.

At the simplest level, it’s about brain chemistry; exercising triggers the release of numerous chemicals that work to elevate mood, reduce inflammation, bolster your immune system, neutralize stress, and more.

But the purely physiological benefits of exercise aren’t the only reason fitness is a key technique for controlling social anxiety. Research also indicates a few secondary benefits. For instance, you canbolster your confidenceby setting and achieving fitness goals. Additionally, you create shared points of reference you can use to navigate social interactions. Finally, you may find it easier to engage other people while distracted by exercise, such as in a fitness class or hobby group.

For the chemical benefits, regular vigorous exercise will show the greatest benefits, as with the other benefits of exercise. Just make sure to avoid the trap of overtraining in your desperation for relief from social anxiety; if you start interfering with sleep quality, hurting yourself, and producing stress hormones because you’re trying to exercise too hard too fast, you’ll undo any benefits you may have earned from your efforts.

Cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT remains a favorite choice for managing anxiety. This is true whether you’re receiving guided therapy with a professional or developing the techniques on your own. Research shows that evenself-taught CBT strategiescan have a drastic effect on your response to the feedback loops and mind states that drive social anxiety.

Much of CBT rests in the process of logically evaluating your feelings when anxiety hits (or depression, or anger, in other conditions). A classic example of a trigger for anxiety would be public speaking. CBT techniques for dealing with anxiety would include asking yourself a series of logical questions:

This is only a small example of what CBT’s full range of techniques encompasses, of course. Other CBT techniques include identifying warnings that you’re about to experience an attack of social anxiety. It also involves spotting the physical and mental flags so you can stop your mind before it starts constructing nightmares for you.

The key benefit of CBT isn’t necessarily in applying logic to your problems, as that won’t always help; it’s about breaking the loop so you don’t feel worse and worse over time. When social anxiety hits, it often pulls you into tight spirals of worry about the single worst potential moment in the worst case scenario. CBT gives you the tools to escape the loop and think about your situation with your full faculties.

There are any number of related techniques for controlling your self-awareness, and all of them offer benefits in managing anxiety. This may seem counter-intuitive if your anxiety tends to manifest as a crippling over-awareness. But similarly to CBT, and in many ways overlapping with its techniques, mindfulness is about controlling the racing thoughts that make you anxious in social situations.

This encompasses a number of techniques.Mindful meditationis perhaps the most popular technique for anxiety sufferers. It has an emphasis on letting go of goals—at least for a moment. Instead, you focus on contentment and awareness in the moment. The closely related field of self-hypnosis offers similar benefits. From a biological standpoint it may function the same, yet it focuses on achieving goals.

Looking at specific techniques, there’s often a focus on redirecting and neutralizing the negative thought patterns associated with anxiety and related ailments. For example, a mindfulness practitioner may recognize anxious patterns and then stop and concentrate exclusively on the sensation of feet pressing against the ground. Or they might focus on breathing, or on the sensations at their fingertips. In other words, they put energy into a combination of visualization and physical feedback as a time-out from anxiety.

Social phobias and anxieties, like all forms of anxiety, can be greatly managed through simple relaxation.

Relaxation techniques encompass a broad selection of relaxing activities, not all of which are as dramatic and obvious as the others. Deep tissue or therapeutic massage, aromatherapy, deep breathing techniques, progressive relaxation, even sitting in a comfy room without interruptions; all of these show benefits for the symptoms of anxiety.

The key here isn’t any particular magic bullet for anxiety hidden in any one of these techniques; rather, you’ll find a broad benefit of relaxation for people experiencing anxiety disorders—social anxiety included.

This is likely the scariest technique for dealing with most phobias, anxieties, and fears; it is also one of the simplest to implement and see benefits from.Exposure therapy for anxietycontinues to be the favored approach to anxiety in clinical settings, especially in combination with CBT, thanks to ease of implementation, efficacy, and efficiency.

Again, comparing the reality of experience against the image in our minds is a key component of managing anxiety. Exposure therapy seeks to create a wealth of experience to draw upon in making these assessments. You can accomplish this by repeated exposure to the perceived threat in a controlled environment.

This might include exercises such as asking dozens of strangers on the street for their phone numbers. It may simply mean introducing yourself to people and shaking hands. Or it could mean calling up businesses in the phone book and asking questions. The point is to put yourself in a stressful environment, but one where failure doesn’t matter. You wait for the anxiety to tire itself out in the face of mundane reality.

This comes with caveats. Doing too much too soon can be counter-productive; you want to be pushed to an uncomfortable place, not a terrifying one. It can also be difficult to practice safe exposure to certain forms of social situation; you can’t easily practice first dates with people you like at will, for example.

These aren’t the only techniques you can rely upon to improve your anxiety—especially if you’re willing to work with a therapist, support group, or psychiatrist. However, they are scientifically proven and easy to implement on your own. You’ll also find that they have a minimum of drawbacks, expenses, or potential side effects. Combine these with general efforts to improve your health such as healthy diet, low-stress living, and good sleep habits. Any one or combination of these techniques should help you make progress over anxiety.

“Why do I feel nervous in social situations?”


Fight Depression and Burnout in 2 Minutes a Day: 3 Good Things Activity - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWfNosruPPw

Transcript:
(00:01) Your brain is so much better at focusing on survival than it is on focusing on being happy, and it's because of this fact that your brain is constantly scanning for threats.  It's trying to pick out, or notice anything bad, dangerous, or negative, instead of looking for the positive, or dwelling on the good things that happen in your life.
(00:23)   Your brain's default setting is to keep you alive, by really paying attention to anything really threatening or dangerous.  This focus on survival was imperative to our ancestors, but in today's world, if left unchecked, it can lead to stress, burnout, and depression, but I have good news, there's a simple way to combat this challenge of focusing on the negative, and to turn up the volume of the positive things in your life.
(00:51)   So, stick around, because in this video I'll teach you how to fight burnout, and feel happier.  It takes just two minutes a day, and thanks to our sponsor, Take Two Minutes, it's easier than ever to get it done.  Okay, so like I said before, our brain is hardwired hardwired for survival.  Which means it's hardwired to notice threats, and to notice the negative.
(01:14)   The negative grabs our attention, while the positive waits for us to notice.  When we just run along in "default mode", this can make us feel depressed, and exhausted.  So here's the super simple way to rewire your brain, it's called: The 3 Good Things Exercise.
(01:31)   For two weeks, before you go to bed, ask yourself  'What are three good things that went well today, and what was my role in making them happen?',  and then just be sure to write them down.  So, for example, yesterday, I had a fairly difficult day, it's winter here, it's cold, and dreary, it's really difficult to get outside with the kids, and with covid, we can't take them to play places, or to see very many friends.
(01:51)   So basically, it was another entire day, couped up in the house, with three super energetic kids, and there may have been some tantrums, and I may have yelled at the kids, and it's just tough sometimes.  Anyways, when I sit down, and think of three good things, it sounds like this: I got to sit on the floor and make a cool sticker puzzle with my three year old, and she really enjoyed it.
(02:18)   Plus, she was practicing her numbers, and she was being quiet during church, so that was really nice bonding time with her.  Number two is: I got to make earrings with my six year old, and it's really fun to make things with her, especially without the two little kids. And then, number three: we had a crazy "wrestle mania" with all the kids in the living room, and that got some wiggles out, and the girls laughed, and screamed a lot, and so that was really fun.
(02:43)   And that's it, that's all there is to it, and when I do it, I feel better, and the amazing result is that research shows that within four to five days, reflecting on the positive leads to noticing more positive. The positive things in your life, and those feelings of happiness, and contentment, just keep growing, and it's like that positive just gets louder.
(03:07)   Clinical trials show that people who do this for fourteen days, have less burnout, and depression, a better work-life balance, less conflict at school, or work, and a higher level of happiness, and the really cool thing is that the results from those fourteen days can last for six months, or more.  So, this exercise, for just two weeks, can impact you for almost a half a year or more, and it just takes two minutes a day, so how cool is that, right?  Now, I think the biggest barrier to doing an activity like this, is that it's easy to forget to do it, but that's where Take Two Minutes comes in.  What they do, is they send you a text message
(03:38) every day, at the time you choose.  This message not only pulls you from your routine to think about your three good things, but it also includes a link to a page where you can enter three good things instantly, instead of having to find a pen, and paper, and then once you complete your entries, they'll store your answers in your personal private journal, which you can easily access at any time to review, and reflect on.  It's super easy.
(04:06)    Seriously though, this activity is so powerful, and Take Two makes it so easy to do it.  They are sponsoring this video, which I am grateful for, but I also seriously love their service.  You can find them by texting JOIN to this number below, or by visiting take2minutes.org.  They also have guided meditations, an easy gratitude journal, and some great resources to help you with anxiety, and sleep, and other stuff.  So,  it's that easy.
(04:35)   Every night before you go to bed, think of three good things that happened to you, and what you did to bring them about.  I would love to hear what your three good things are.  Leave yours down in the comments section below.   Thanks you for watching,  and take care.



The Secret to Stopping Fear and Anxiety (That Actually Works) | Mel Robbins - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n8i7ua0mSw

Transcript:
(00:05) you know I've heard a lot of experts say that fear isn't real that is such a bunch of baloney fear is so real in fact there are probably things that you're afraid of doing right now in your life in your relationships and work and the fact that you're afraid that's robbing you of all of the experiences that you want to have in your life I mean if you're afraid to fly that's going to limit your ability to travel and see the world or go visit friends if you're afraid of public speaking that's going
(00:41) to really limit your ability to express yourself and share your ideas if if you're afraid of talking to your boss or asking for a raise that directly impacts how much money you make or what if you are dreaming of starting a business or you've already started a new business but you're afraid to talk to people and you're afraid to share your business with people I mean fear is something that stops us all and that's why I'm here to talk to you because it doesn't have to fear is real but I am going to
(01:13) share a secret weapon that I have used for years to beat every single fear that used to stop me now first before we get into this secret weapon I just want to cover a few facts about fear What It Is What It Isn't and some things that you may may not know about fear so first thing fear is a physical state in your body that is exactly the same as excitement let me say that again fear and excitement are the exact same physical state your heart races you might sweat a little bit you might feel tightening in your chest you might feel
(01:53) a pit in your stomach uh you have a surge of cortisol it's basically the way that your body goes into a hyperaware State because it's readying for Action Now what's the difference between fear and excitement really simple the only difference between fear and excitement is what your brain is doing as your body is all agitated if you're excited your brain's going oh wow this is going to be so cool to ride this roller coaster if you're afraid your brain's going oh no way there's no way I'm doing that this
(02:30) is dangerous get out of there don't do that it's saying something different so what's critical about understanding this is that we're going to use the fact that your mind is either working for you for excitement or against you with fear to your advantage and I'll tell you about it in just a minute how you're going to do that second thing I want you to understand is that you may have heard the advice Feel the fear and do it anyway you may have heard the advice oh just try to calm down think positive
(02:59) thoughts it doesn't work does it and there's a reason why it doesn't work so let's go back to fact number one when you're afraid your body is in a state of arousal and agitation and your heart is racing and you're all like amped up and you're hyper aware of what's going on and you're freaking out a little bit what is it like when you're calm you just kind of chill right you got like this low arousal State very very difficult to go from a state of agitation of being all jacked up and
(03:33) excited and weirded out and to a kind of state it doesn't work it's like trying to stop a train by throwing a boulder on the tracks it's going to make the train jump off the tracks it's going to cause a disaster in fact they've proven in research that when you try to ignore your fears it actually makes them worse and they've also proven in research that positive thinking alone also can make your fears wor worse so what do you do what do do you do when you're about to go talk to your boss and
(04:02) you feel afraid what do you do when you have to get on a plane and you're actually terrified of flying what do you do if you got to give a presentation and you are afraid of public speaking here's what you're going to do you're going to use a strategy the same one that I use that has helped me beat every single fear and turned me into somebody that is terrific when it comes to a high stress situation this is how you do it you're going to use my 5-second rule in combination with what I call an anchor
(04:32) thought and that is going to reframe what your mind is doing so that your mind goes from feeling agitation and making you afraid to reframing it from agitation to excitement it works like magic now I have used this technique for years literally for years and one of the ways that I want to introduce you to it is I want to take you backstage I want to take you back stage to a speech that I delivered this year and what you're going to see is you're going to see me behind you know the major set I'm about to walk out you
(05:09) can kind of hear the crowd roaring my introductory video is playing my body is in a state of arousal I am literally my heart is racing my arms are sweating like it's like you're going to see this I'm going to tell you about it and you're going to watch me use this same technique I'm going to teach you to reframe my nerves into excitement check this out all right I'm about to go on stage there are 7,000 people out there and it's so exciting because what they don't know is they're about to learn the
(05:39) 5-second rule and their lives will never be the same again now I got to tell you my heart is racing um my armpits are sweating I have the exact same physiological feeling as when I'm afraid but I'm not afraid I'm excited excitement and fear is the exact same thing in your body it's just what your brain calls it here's a trick that's proven by science that I use every time I speak when I start to sweat when I start to have butterflies when I start to have my heart race I say I'm excited
(06:11) I'm excited to get out there I'm excited to talk to these people I'm excited to share the 5-sec rule and what that does is it sends a message to my brain that tells my brain why my body's all agitated and excited and that way I don't feel afraid remember excitement and fear exact same thing in your body the only difference is what your brain calls it that's why you want those go get now I want to give you one more example just to make sure that you really get how you can use this so a lot
(06:45) of you have written to me about your fear of flying and I can really relate to that fear because I used to have the exact same fear but I use this same strategy to conquer it here's how you're going to do it so first things first if you've got to do something that really makes you nervous or that you're afraid to do before you're about to do it come up with an anchor thought what's an anchor thought well an anchor thought is something that's going to Anchor you so that you don't escalate any situation
(07:16) into a full-blown panic attack or into a situation where you screw things up it's a way for you to Anchor yourself so you maintain control over what you're thinking and how you behave so here's an example with flying it's important when you're creating an anchor thought to pick something that is in the proper context of what you're afraid to do so for flying pick an anchor thought that has to do with the trip that you're taking so if I'm boarding a plane to fly back home to Michigan an anchor thought
(07:47) might be a picture in my mind of my mom and I walking on the shores of Lake Michigan where I grew up that's a thought that makes me happy it makes me excited and it's also related to the trip that I'm taking if you have a conversation that you need to have with your boss pick an anchor thought about how you feel after having that conversation maybe it's you picking up the phone and calling somebody that you you love and saying oh my gosh it went so well or you know you walking out of the meeting and feeling like yeah I
(08:19) survived that conversation I feel pretty good about myself so now that you have your anchor thought you're ready to beat the fear how you're going to do it is this so let's go back back to the example of the plane I'm on the plane I'm flying to Michigan we hit turbulence my body's going to start getting agitated right I'm starting to get nervous my heart starts to race one of two things can happen I can't control how my body might feel but I can always always control what I'm thinking about
(08:49) and I can always control how I act and so can you so when I'm on a plane and the turbulence hits 5 43 2 1 that's step one and it's essential and the reason why using the 5c Rule 5 4 3 2 1 is essential is because that is how you switch the gears in your mind you awaken your prefrontal cortex and you trigger your brain that you're now in control of your thoughts you've interrupted the fear you've settled your thoughts and now your brain is ready for that anchor thought so then what I do after I go 54
(09:22) 3 2 1 is I insert the anchor thought that I've already come up with before the flight I start thinking about walking on the beach and being with my mom and my dad and I start telling myself I'm so excited to walk on the shores of Lake Michigan I'm so excited to see my parents now something remarkable is going to happen in your brain because you've interrupted the fear and because you've used the 5-second rule to assert control and awaken your prefrontal cortex and because you have an image that
(09:56) contextually makes sense to your brain because you're flying to Michigan you know your brain does your brain goes huh Mel's excited to go to Michigan because my body is in a state remember the first fact fear and excitement exact same thing what's the difference between fear and excitement what your brain is saying using the 5-second rule and an anchor thought you can actually switch the gears in your mind and reframe the thoughts of fear into thoughts of excitement and because you have a vision

Living withsocial anxiety disordercan mean that even the most casual social interactions leave you trembling, dizzy, and afraid of criticism or rejection.

Severe social anxiety can affect your day-to-day life by making it difficult to engage in commonplace activities, such as:

Managing social anxiety usually isn’t as simple as tossing yourself into a crowd, but it’s still an entirely achievable goal.

Looking for ways to feel more comfortable in social situations and interact with others more easily? These 9 strategies offer a place to begin.

Despite what some people might suggest, social anxiety goes beyondshyness, or feeling uneasy and nervous around new people. Social anxiety is a mental health condition, and it’s not always possible to work through symptoms yourself.

Youcando a lot on your own to manage the anxiety and distress you experience, but gettingprofessional supportis always a good place to start.

A trained mental health professional can:

Therapy also offers a safe environment to practice navigating anxiety-provoking situations throughgraduated exposure, one potential treatment for social anxiety.

Your therapist might recommend group therapy or support groups, which give you the chance to practice social skills and interact with other people also coping with social anxiety.

A therapist can also refer you to a psychiatrist, who can prescribe medication for social anxiety. Medication can provide some relief from severe symptoms, making it easier to start working through them in therapy.

Social anxiety doesn’t show up in the same way for everyone.

You might feel anxious about any situation where you worry about others judging you, from ordering food at a restaurant to leaving for the restroom during a class lecture. On the other hand, you could feel mostly fine simply being around others — as long as they don’t expect you to share your thoughts or speak up.

Pinpointing why and when you feel most anxious can help you take the first steps toward finding solutions to power through those feelings.

Tip: Start by listing situations that cause the most discomfort, the ones you feel utterly unable to face. These might include:

Noting the symptoms you usually experience can also help you deal with them more effectively:

Chances are, you spend a lot of time thinking about the potential negative outcomes of those social situations you just listed.

You might worry about:

These things do happen on occasion, and they certainly can cause some short-term discomfort. It can feel frightening to imagine yourself in a similarly awkward situation, but try to keep things in perspective.

Even if you do make a small social blunder, that doesn’t mean other people will look down on you. In fact, they might remember a time when they found themselves in a similar position and offer empathy and compassion instead. Bonding over past awkward experiences could even help you make a new friend.

When you begin to feel overwhelmed by anxious thoughts, trychallenging and replacing themwith more helpful ones through a technique called realistic thinking. You can try this by asking yourself some basic questions about the scenario that’s worrying you and providing honest, balanced answers.

Say you’ve just started a new job, and your co-workers have invited you to their monthly happy hour. You’d like to get to know them better, but you feel terrified that you might say or do something that affects their opinion of you. Consider these questions and how you might answer them:

Understanding thespotlight effect— the tendency to think others notice your mistakes more than they actually do — can also go a long way toward easing feelings of social anxiety.

You might believe everyone’s staring at you after an awkward faux pas, but most people probably didn’t even notice. Those who did? They’ll probably forget what happened pretty quickly.

When it comes to managing social anxiety, it’s just fine to start with little changes. You don’t have to volunteer to lead a meeting or strike up a conversation with everyone you meet.

A few ideas to try:

Some people also find it helpful to rename anxious feelings.

Instead of thinking “I feel so nervous about tonight,” try thinking “I’m so excited to see what people are like outside of work!” instead.

All those negative outcomes you worry about? Practicing ways to get through them ahead of time can help you feel more prepared to handle themifthey come up during an interaction.

Ask a trusted friend or family member to role-play some everyday conversations with you.

A few scenarios:

Tip: To get more familiar with best- and worst-case outcomes, ask your conversation partner to offer different positive, negative, or neutral reactions.

Like general anxiety, social anxiety can involve overwhelming and uncomfortablephysical symptoms, including:

Relaxation exercises can help calm these physical reactions, making it easier to manage worry, fear, and the other emotional symptoms you experience.

4-7-8 breathing:

Progressive muscle relaxation:

Regular physical activity can also help improve your mood byeasing anxious feelingsandpromoting relaxation.

In a2015 studyof 115 college students living with social anxiety, performing small acts of kindness for 4 weeks helped reduce the desire to avoid social situations.

The link betweenkindnessand social anxiety may not be immediately clear, but it makes sense, when you think about it.

Social anxiety generally involves somefear of rejectionor disapproval. But if you’ve just done something kind and thoughtful, like bringing a sick co-worker their favorite soup or offering to pick up your neighbor’s grocery order, the person you help is far more likely to have positive feelings toward you than negative ones.

Earning this approval on a regular basis can help decrease your fears around social situations, so you might find that interacting with others gradually becomes easier.

A drink or two often seems like a great way to ease social anxiety and feel more comfortable in social settings. Certainly, a small amount of alcohol can help you feel more relaxed — but alcohol can alsointensify feelings of anxietyand leave you feeling worse.

If you regularly use alcohol to manage social anxiety symptoms, you could eventually reach a point where you find it impossible to socialize without alcohol. You might also end up needing to drink more to see the same effects.

Consider trying out amindful drinkingapproach, which involves cultivating awareness around when you drink, how much you drink, and how it makes you feel.

Some people swear by cannabis for social anxiety, andevidence from 2015suggests CBD may offer some benefits.

Just keep in mind not everyone responds to cannabis in the same way. It may not have much of an effect, but it could also worsen your anxiety. Always start with small doses and pay close attention to unwanted side effects before trying more.

Learn more about using cannabis for anxiety.

OK, so you know avoiding social situations entirely won’t do much to improve social anxiety. But you’ll also want to steer clear of tactics that keep your participation superficial. For example:

You might feel safer among the crowd when you show upwithout really engaging, but this doesn’t do you any favors when it comes to overcoming social anxiety. People may not reject you, but they can’t reallyget to know youunless you truly make an effort to interact.

Letting go of these not-so-helpful coping tactics may feel tough at first, but most people find the eventual payoff — improvedrelationships— well worth it.

Get more tips on making friends when living with social anxiety.

Feeling self-conscious around others and fearing the possibility of their disapproval can make it difficult to forge connections with potentialfriendsor romantic partners.

It’s perfectly fine to stay single or haveonly a few friends. But when social anxiety holds you back from new relationships, a few changes can make a big difference.

True, some people you meet may simply not like you, but that’s OK. It happens. The more interactions you have, the more likely you’ll encounter people who reallydoget you — and welcome you with open arms.

Have you ever felt nervous or uncomfortable in a social situation? Maybe you had plans to go out with some new friends for dinner but found yourself too on edge to walk into the restaurant, or you sat in a meeting at work and chose to stay quiet and notshare your ideas. These feelings often arise fromsocial anxiety—the fear of saying or doing something wrong. But beneath that fear is an even greater fear—the fear of being judged or rejected1https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-deal-with-rejectionby others.

If you think you might have some level of social anxiety, don’t worry—you are not alone. We are social animals2https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2527715/and need to fit into our social groups, whether we areintrovertsor extroverts.

Watch our founder Vanessa Van Edwards talk you through some of the best ways to overcome social anxiety.

Social anxiety is an anxiety disorder that is also known as social phobia. It is characterized by an intense and persistent fear of social situations and interactions. People with social anxiety often experience overwhelming anxiety, self-consciousness, and worry about being judged, embarrassed, or humiliated in social settings

Think back to the last social situation you were in—try to remember how you felt and what you were thinking. Did you feel comfortable in your body or have flutters in your chest3https://greatist.com/connect/emotional-body-maps-infographic? Did you think how happy you were to see your old friends, or were you self-conscious about what they thought of you?

Well, if you experience the following psychological and/or physical symptoms of anxiety, you could consider yourself as having some level of social anxiety:

Note: If you experience these to an extreme degree, you might want to consider speaking to a professional, as you could be experiencing a social anxiety disorder6https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/social-anxiety-disorder.

It’s important to note that social anxiety is different fromshyness. While shyness is a personality trait, social anxiety is a mental health condition that can significantly impact your daily life.

Social anxiety can be disabling in some cases. It can interfere with a person’s ability to work, attend school, or have a fulfilling social life – especially as so many people with severe social anxiety struggle with other mental health conditions, such as depression7https://www.webmd.com/depression/recovery-overview. However, with proper treatment and management strategies, many people with social anxiety can overcome the majority of their symptoms and live a normal life.

Science hasn’t yet figured out exactly the causes of social anxiety, but many signs point to a mix of genetics and environmental8https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/social-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353561factors. There may be some experiences in early life that seem to be linked to developing anxiety later in life (such as bullying, forgetting your lines in a school play, or another embarrassing9https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK327674/social event).

What triggers social anxiety? The triggers can vary from person to person, but common triggers include:

So, can social anxiety be cured? While there is no cure for social anxiety, it is a treatable condition. Treatment options include therapy, medication, and self-help strategies like mindfulness and relaxation techniques.

Remember that everyone experiences social anxiety differently, and what works for one person may not work for another. It’s important to find the strategies that work best for you.

Managing social anxiety can be challenging, but there are strategies that can help. Use the following tips like a buffet—take the ideas that take your fancy, and leave the ones that don’t feel fit for you.

Everyone is different, and accepting and knowing your own boundaries and needs is an important step on your way to healing.

Set realistic expectations: Avoid putting excessive pressure on yourself to be perfect or to please everyone. Set realistic expectations and remind yourself that it’s okay to make mistakes or have moments of discomfort.

The best way to make a plan is to sit with pen and paper and physically write down what your goals are—you can use this to help you direct your exposure therapy or just as a way of tracking things you would like to be able to do.

Here are some goals you could use to get started on your plan.

Writing a plan can help keep you focused and will highlight for you the achievements you have accomplished. You might find it helpful to keep your plan somewhere you can see it regularly.

Make sure you follow through with your goals using the following

When you experience big emotions, it can be tempting to hide them away and not think about them. This can be especially tempting if, during your childhood, you were told not to cry12https://sleepingshouldbeeasy.com/stop-crying/or express your feelings in any way.

But, if you want to start conquering your social anxiety, the first step is to acknowledge that you areexperiencingsocial anxiety13https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/social-anxiety-disorder-more-than-just-shynessand to accept the emotions that are coming with that experience.

This means recognizing the symptoms of social anxiety, sitting with your emotions, and accepting them without judgment or shame.

You can do this by pausing to RAIN.

Therapists have used the RAIN method for years to provide a structured framework for managing difficult emotions by encouraging individuals to Recognize, Allow, Investigate, and Nurture their inner experiences.

By fostering self-awareness, acceptance14https://psychcentral.com/lib/ways-to-accept-yourself, curiosity, and self-compassion, the method helps to develop a healthier relationship with your emotions, leading to greater emotional well-being, including in social situations.

Here are some things you could say to yourself while you let it RAIN.

Using this method should help the feelings pass through you easier. Sometimes it can help to visualize your thoughts as just passing past you—maybe like cars on the road or boats floating over you if you could lay on the bottom of the ocean. Let them pass through without judgment rather than hold onto them and let them rattle around your mind.

Don’t underestimate the power of a deep breath. There is an established body of literature on how slow deep breaths positively impact15https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6137615/our emotional control and physical well-being.

Science shows that your brain will benefit from the boost of oxygen, your heart will thank you for helping it calm down, and your anxiety should take a back seat. This is because deep breathing helps to suppress a part of your nervous system known as the parasympathetic nervous system. This part is responsible for activating your fight or flight, so suppressing it signals to your body that you are safe. After all, however much you feel in danger, you feel you are safe.

Here are some different types of breathing you could learn to put into use just before or during social situations:

Get the hang of these breathing techniques in the comfort of your own home until they become second nature, and then start to use them when your social anxiety kicks in—before your big speech, as you walk into the house of a new friend, or before you approach your colleagues.

Do you struggle with nervous laughter? Watch our video to learn why you do it and how to stop:

Start by gradually exposing yourself to social situations that make you anxious. You don’t want to throw yourself in the deep end with situations that consume you with worry. Instead, begin with low-pressure environments and gradually work your way up.

This is called exposure therapy18https://www.verywellmind.com/practice-social-anxiety-disorder-exposure-therapy-3024845. The idea behind exposure therapy for social anxiety is to build tolerance and expand your comfort zone in small steps.

You can get a professional to help you with this, but you can also try DIY exposure therapy19https://www.healthcentral.com/article/diy-exposure-therapy-social-situations, especially if you can enlist some trusted friends or even trusted coworkers.

Start by creating a hierarchy of social situations that trigger anxiety, ranging from least to most anxiety-provoking. Begin with the least anxiety-inducing situation, such as using aconversation starteron a familiar acquaintance. Practice this scenario repeatedly until it becomes more comfortable.

Here are a few ideas to start you off (in order of least anxiety-inducing to most anxiety-inducing) that you could use over the space of a few months. (Remember, you want to practice each one over a series of days to weeks until you feel more comfortable about it)

1. Smile at a stranger

2.Say helloor good morning to a stranger

3. Ask someone in the street for directions

4. Order a takeaway by phoning the restaurant yourself

5. Make small talk with a cashier in a supermarket you haven’t been to before

6. Post a video of yourself talking to the camera on your social media (if you aren’t sure

what to talk about, talk about how you are making a video as part of your journey to

overcome social media).

7. Do aQ&A on TikTokor another social media platform

8. Go for dinner on your own

9. Go to a party at someone’s house on your own

10. Host a presentation at work (Vanessa has somegreat ideas for presentations)

You can edit this list to suit you, but the important thing is that you gradually progress to more challenging situations. Each step should be approached at your own pace, allowing time tobuild confidenceand reduce anxiety.

Therapy, especially Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which can significantly aid in addressing social anxiety by giving you the necessary tools to support and manage your fears and improve your social interactions.

Therapy delves deep, and it can be a challenge to really untangle some of the roots of your social anxiety. Still, by doing this, you can gain valuable insight into the underlying causes of your anxiety, as well as challenge negative thoughts and beliefs and learn practical coping strategies.

Traditionally, CBT was accessed in person, but there is now a trend moving towards online CBT20https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23252357/, which proves to be just as effective (in some cases, more effective as clients are working in their home environment, which feels safer and more familiar).

Here are three tools you can learn through therapy to help manage your social anxiety:

Therapy tends to be a long way around healing—it is certainly not a quick fix. But it does focus on the root, so it is often the best way to manage social anxiety over the long term22https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3263389/.

This tip might sound a little ‘too good to be true’ as it is easy and takes up so little of your time.

Positive affirmations are just empowering statements that you repeat to cultivate a positive mindset and reinforce desired beliefs or outcomes. In the context of social anxiety, you can use positive affirmations to help you believe you can overcome the challenges you face in social situations.

By consciously affirming your strengths, goals, and potential, you can enhance your self-confidence, motivation, and overall well-being.

For positive affirmations to work best, you want to ensure you incorporate them into yourdaily routine, as repetition helps them to work. Science shows23https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=study+on+positive+affirmatinosthat positive self-affirmations work on the reward and valuation parts of our brain,

If you’re not sure where to start, choose about five affirmations and write them on a sticky note. Stick the note on your bathroom mirror, and starting tomorrow, after your morning shower or brushing your teeth, recite them—either out loud or in your head.

The important bit is you take your time toreallyput feeling behind each affirmation and that you spend this time consciously.

Here are some examples you could use to get you started:

Once you have spent a few days doing affirmations in this way, you will find you have started to memorize them. At this point, you are able to easily take them out of the comfort of your home and apply them before or during social events.

The term’ body doubling’24https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/body-double-adhdhas come from ADHD communities to describe having a second person with you when completing tasks you find difficult. This technique can be helpful for social anxiety too.

While you don’t want to become co-dependent on your family or friends, it can sometimes get you over the first few hurdles as you overcome some of the more intense symptoms of social anxiety.

For a body double, choose a friend or family member, or even a colleague. They should be someone you trust and someone who has less social anxiety than you do. Confide in thistrusted personabout your anxiety, and ask them to body double with you.

Some tasks you could ask your body double to help with include:

After you have done a few tasks with your body double, especially if you repeat a few of the tasks together for weeks or months, you will likely find it easier to tackle these situations on your own.

‘Grounding’ describes a set of techniques that help bring your attention to the present moment and create a sense of stability and connection between yourself and your surroundings. There are lots of ways you can ground yourself25https://www.healthline.com/health/grounding-techniques, including:

One of the most popular and widely used grounding techniques is the “5-4-3-2-1” method.

The 5-4-3-2-1 Method:Pull your attention to this grounding task by finding somewhere with minimal distractions. Take a deep breath to focus yourself and start to identify and mentally note:

Once you try the 5-4-3-2-1 method a few times, it will become second nature to you. This technique helps redirect your focus away from anxious thoughts and into your immediate sensory experience, grounding you in the present moment.

Get some trusted friends or family members and practice your small talk! This might sound ridiculous initially, but you will be surprised how quickly you will develop some go-to subjects when you are put on the spot in social interaction.

Here are some scenarios you could role-play with your most trusted friends and family to help you prepare for them in real life:

Instead of worrying about the future or dwelling on past experiences, try to stay present. When we feel anxious in a social setting, our mind tells us that we are in danger—even though we are not! There is no tiger about to eat us. We are not dangling over the edge of a cliff. We are not stuck in the middle of a tornado with no shelter in sight. We are just nervous about the potential of being embarrassed or being rejected by our social group.

To remind your body you are not in any real danger, here are some ways you can stay in the moment:

Remember, staying present is a practice that may require patience and persistence. By incorporating these ideas into your daily life, you can cultivate a greater sense of presence and fully experience each moment as it unfolds.

Often, social anxiety comes from lackingothersocial skills.

This is an easy barrier to overcome as all you need to do is work a little bit daily to enhance your other social skills like practicing assertiveness, active listening, starting conversations, communicating effectively, or introducing yourself to new people.

The more confident you feel in your social abilities, the less anxious you’ll be.

I get it. I understand—sticking your head in the sand is the easiest way to confront your social anxiety.

Big deadline coming up? Let’s go tidy the bathroom instead. Worried about how you are going to tackle that next presentation at work? Let’s start Googling something entirely unrelated.

Avoiding social situations perpetuates anxiety but provides us with an easy fix.

This perpetuates a cycle where we take the short-term relief of avoidance over the more sustainable and healthier method of actually tackling what the issue at hand really is. To overcome this cycle, you need to gradually confront and challenge avoidance behaviors by slowly increasing your exposure to anxiety-inducing situations.

At its core, this means learning to sit with uncomfortable feelings. It means learning to be able to stay with your feeling of anxiety and for it not to drive you to avoid it.

This is easier said than done, but if you use the other tips mentioned in this article—especially those on mindfulness—then you should be on the right track to being able to do this.

Be proud of your efforts and reward yourself for your bravery.

As part of a holistic approach to working on your personal growth, consider working on your confidence. Confident people are less likely29https://www.verywellmind.com/self-esteem-and-social-anxiety-4158220to have problems with social anxiety.

Here are some ways to work on your confidence:

Remember, confidence is a skill that can be developed and strengthened over time. Be patient with yourself, celebrate your achievements, and embrace the process of personal growth.

And finally, find other people to look up to.

All over social media, many other people are working on healing their social anxiety.

Following some of these accounts can make you feel less on your own while you overcome these hurdles and can provide emotional and practical support while you take on your journey.

I as well deal with anxiety anywhere and have been for a long time now. I started meds and then got off of them. What I been starting to do lately is go through it to get over it. Meaning the things I fear the most that will cause a trigger to anxiety I push myself to go there and not turn back and if I do I look forward in baby steps without looking back so I do become so hard on myself.

Sometimes it feels like my world is about to stop and crack in the process. I lose my voice, I lose my breathe as I forget to breath. For seconds it feels like the temperature of the room has inflated and the person in front of me is a six feet monster. My throat begins to feel dry and during the time when I’m faced with that person I feel overwhelming tears build up in my eyes. All I want to do is to run, escape as the fear of making mistakes shakes me.

It’s really hard dealing with it and it’s funny I only feel bad when it comes to talking to peoole much older than me with my peers it’s much easier but with adults it is a whole different case. I really want to get over this and I’m hoping this helps me.

It's normal to feel nervous in some social situations. For example, going on a date or giving a presentation may cause that feeling of butterflies in your stomach. But in social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, everyday interactions cause significant anxiety, self-consciousness and embarrassment because you fear being scrutinized or judged negatively by others.

In social anxiety disorder, fear and anxiety lead to avoidance that can disrupt your life. Severe stress can affect your relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities.

Social anxiety disorder can be a chronic mental health condition, but learning coping skills in psychotherapy and taking medications can help you gain confidence and improve your ability to interact with others.

Social anxiety disorder care at Mayo Clinic

Feelings of shyness or discomfort in certain situations aren't necessarily signs of social anxiety disorder, particularly in children. Comfort levels in social situations vary, depending on personality traits and life experiences. Some people are naturally reserved and others are more outgoing.

In contrast to everyday nervousness, social anxiety disorder includes fear, anxiety and avoidance that interfere with relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities. Social anxiety disorder typically begins in the early to mid-teens, though it can sometimes start in younger children or in adults.

Signs and symptoms of social anxiety disorder can include constant:

For children, anxiety about interacting with adults or peers may be shown by crying, having temper tantrums, clinging to parents or refusing to speak in social situations.

Performance type of social anxiety disorder is when you experience intense fear and anxiety during speaking or performing in public but not in other types of more general social situations.

Physical signs and symptoms can sometimes accompany social anxiety disorder and may include:

Common, everyday experiences may be hard to endure when you have social anxiety disorder, including:

Social anxiety disorder symptoms can change over time. They may flare up if you're facing a lot of changes, stress or demands in your life. Although avoiding situations that produce anxiety may make you feel better in the short term, your anxiety is likely to continue over the long term if you don't get treatment.

See your doctor or a mental health professional if you fear and avoid normal social situations because they cause embarrassment, worry or panic.

How can I stop overthinking everything?





Your Constant Overthinking Ends With This Video - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zezNDS9PHRQ

Transcript:
(00:00) in ancient japan sometime between 1550 and 1600 there lived a boy named kintaro kawasaka kintaro was an 18 year old aspiring samurai from a small village in the ichigo province whose bloodline had produced some of the most powerful samurais over the past several hundred years but for quintaro his skill with the sword was lagging far behind that of his predecessors it wasn't that he was physically incapable of being one of the greats in fact he was stronger than many of the samurai that were already in their 20s what kintaro's greatest
(00:32) weakness was was the regulation of his own mind this massive setback which is so crucial for the development of any practice of the sword caused him to move rigidly with much more force than others his age and the constant overwhelm he would feel from his thoughts would often leave him vulnerable to attacks from his fellow students what if i never get better what if i end up dying out there one day where is his next move coming from those were the types of thoughts that would cloud his mind during training for as long as he could
(01:00) remember kintaro's mind operated this way his mother died when he was little after an attack from a neighboring village and his relationship with his father suffered because of it after the attack kintaro's father constantly put the blame on himself he too would overthink and worry about every little thing that happened to him and how he wished he would have been home that evening to protect his wife when kintaro saw the state of agony in which his father was left in on a daily basis he unintentionally absorbed that same sort
(01:29) of thinking from him for years growing up he'd watch his father pace back and forth at night wondering if another attack would strike their village once again his father couldn't bear the thought of potentially losing his only son too and so he was constantly hyper vigilant he tell kintaro always watch your back always anticipate the next move you never know what's going to happen you need to be constantly evaluating your environment and looking for any signs of danger catastrophe could be only one second away be
(02:00) prepared for it that is the way of the samurai this shaped kintaro's developing years drastically anytime he would make a mistake he'd dwell on it for the entire day until he was finally able to fall asleep he'd think out every other possible scenario he could have done in that moment and go around in circles until he drove himself mad then he'd overthink about the fact that he was just overthinking for so long and think more along with overthinking the past the uncertainty of his future made him
(02:28) paranoid as well he would try to overanalyze each potential next step he could take in his life and whether it was the right one or not and in his training he tried to predict his opponent's next move with too much effort one day during a training session while kintaro was clashing wooden swords with a student that was on par with him in skills his blood was boiling more than usual his rage came from a particularly bad argument the night before with his father that conversation kept replaying over and over as he was
(02:56) swaying back and forth dodging the student's swings until eventually his mind got the best of him under the hypnosis of extreme anger he grabbed the student threw him to the ground and began beating his face in until his instructors pulled him off what the hell is wrong with you one of the instructors said this is the third time this has happened this month no true samurai would have fits like this hasn't your father taught you how important the nurturing of your mind is before kintaro could respond with a resentful discourse
(03:25) explaining all the reasons why he disliked his father a figure appeared in between his two instructors he was a bald man dressed in robes of brown and orange takeshi one of the instructors said why are you here i just so happened to be walking near the dojo when i saw this young man's fighting skills the elderly man said immediately i could tell he lacked a discipline of the mind with each over-calculated stroke of his sword but i can see something in him why don't you let him come with me for a bit the old
(03:55) man speaking was takashi kagawa one of the most respected elders of the village for the past 80 years of his life he had been studying and practicing the art of zen buddhism it was even rumored that he went 100 straight days meditating in the same position on top of the village mountain in the heart of winter with no food if anyone was going to fix kintaro's incessant overthinking it was him if you truly want to take him under you then by all means one of the instructors said excellent come with me young man as kintaro and takeshi walk
(04:27) through one of the village's gardens the old man asked kintaro what his upbringing looked like as he explained what happened to his mother and his relationship with his father it all became clear to takeshi yes that does not surprise me now tomorrow at dawn you are to meet me at the river next to the residents of the takahashi family there i will explain to you the cause of your suffering the next morning kintaro made his way to the river when he arrived he saw takeshi there waiting for him with a small bucket in his hand good to see you here
(05:00) kintaro let's begin first i want you to take this bucket and fill it up with water from the river after giving takeshi a confused look kintaro grabbed the bucket and filled it up after he done so he asked okay what now now i want you to try to understand the river by looking at this water after you've done that let me know what you find kintaro looked at the water in the bucket his face started to tense up he squinted his eyes and wrinkles appeared on his forehead as he thought about every possible explanation to the old
(05:32) man's request his brain started to irritate him but after several minutes he turned to takeshi well i guess the river is a flowing stream that eventually leads somewhere and when the water is no longer a part of the stream it can no longer be considered part of the river that's why you put it in this bucket right the old man laughed a wise observation but not the point i was trying to get across you see i made you look at the water as a way to expose how your mind works you endlessly strain your brain trying to look for answers to
(06:02) things like what you could have done better in the past or what your opponent's next move will be but trying to understand each little thing that happens has happened or will happen to you is like trying to understand a river by scooping out a bucket of water and analyzing it you truly understand a river simply by just experiencing that river not thinking about it kintaro you must become more like water it flows and nurtures all without second guessing itself do you think the water thinks about where the stream is taking it no
(06:34) it trusts the guidance of the river and simply just is before you were conditioned with your current state of mind you too occupied this same sort of being before you were taught a language and the words in that language to attach onto you are simply just a conscious being riding a stream of different sensations experiences and feelings this is why babies do not feel guilty when they cry laugh or make a mistake they have no conception of a self that can make a mistake in the first place crying is not bad to them it's just crying
(07:07) laughing is not good it's just laughing babies are what they are at that moment but when the word was instilled into you you had a way to attach to those things and judge them you were given a name and identity and meanings behind things through words your father instilled his beliefs into you through words and conditioned you to react to things and behave in a certain way he told you feeling this way is wrong and feeling this way is right do things like this and not like this and worst of all that you should always think your way out of
(07:41) unwanted situations and feelings eventually you got so deeply attached to these words that you started misrepresenting real life itself with the words that symbolize it this is where the root cause of all your overthinking lies your father gave you his ways of viewing the world which were deeply embedded in attaching to words and overusing them to the point of self-destruction you then started to believe that the solution to your overthinking lied in trying to think about the solution but what you need to do is the exact opposite i am sure that
(08:15) you've gone through and seen many traumatic things in your past and you think about all the possible ways it could have gone differently likewise your worrying and anxiety is caused by an inability to know things in the future with certainty and giving up that certainty is an act of rebellion against your overthinking mind but the first step to controlling your thoughts about the past and future is not trying to control them to become fully one with the present moment is to fully accept that no amount of overthinking will ever
(08:46) change the outcome of what will happen to change to this way of being is no easy task especially since you've been conditioned to act the complete opposite for so long but you will get there through my training every day for at least 30 minutes i want you to come sit here by this river and meditate you will sit upright with your legs crossed with your spine straight and your eyes half open looking down a couple feet in front of you and you will direct your awareness to your breath when you inhale count to one and when you exhale count
(09:19) to two do this with each inhale and exhale up to 10 then start back at 1. only by repeatedly doing this every day will you come to fully understand what i'm trying to explain here through my words kintaro stared at the man in astonishment although his explanation of his suffering helped him to grasp his inner torment he wasn't sure how sitting and breathing was going to change anything after all he did that already on a daily basis but unconsciously i'm not really sure if this will work but all right i'll do it excellent and one
(09:52) last tip takeshi said remove any and all expectations from this practice do not do it to seek some sort of goal for yourself because that will take away from the point entirely i'll leave you bee now the old man walked through the rocks and onto the nearest path when kintaro could no longer see him he decided he would start his practice today at first it was awkward and the setting position was kind of painful he found himself getting discouraged at the fact that still his mind would brace and would never stop racing or sometimes his
(10:24) mind would wander away from his breath and he'd realize it was wandering and then he'd beat himself up for it god damn it he said how am i supposed to be present if i'm still having thoughts this continued on for the next couple weeks but still he refused to give up and by the 15th day he finally made a breakthrough in his practice while doing his daily meditation he became aware of a group of birds chirping just above the river without shifting his eyes away from his meditation practice he simply
(10:54) just allowed himself to listen to each chirp intently and eventually he found himself not trying to categorize what he was listening to he didn't judge the sound or put a name to it the sound just was after that brief moment of bliss he found he had unlocked an insight into his practice he felt his body's contact points with the ground below him he became aware of the fresh smell of flowers growing by the river he heard the gentle flowing of the river stream in a way he had never experienced before all of his senses were tuned to the
(11:26) present moment and his concept of a separate self started to dissipate as a result he found that the chatter in his mind quieted itself naturally and had less of an effect on him and when he finished his practice that day he felt a sense of calm and stillness he hadn't been aligned with in years everything around him felt so much more real and lifelike when he was looking at trees he was really looking at them instead of thinking this is a tree while looking at it and in that way he became the tree the next day he felt even more
(12:00) invigorated he had a constant stream of thoughts come in and out of his mind but he let them be and observed them without judging them he came face to face with the self he had identified with and suppressed for so long but without overly attaching to it he realized that there was no such thing as wrong feelings or wrong thoughts and that he was not his feelings or thoughts but rather the observer of them the only thing he could truly be was this moment he separated himself from his emotional reaction to his thoughts and past
(12:31) traumas accepted them and let them go whenever they felt like exiting his mind this then started spilling into his everyday life he became better at catching when he felt himself getting too overly attached to the words that clouded his head and re-centered himself every time that happened by focusing on his breath and five senses in the present moment and soon he found he could turn on that state of meditation at will almost all the time even without sitting and actively trying to meditate in fact he realized that it was
(13:02) impossible to be anything but the present moment anything else was an illusion created by the words and fantasies in his mind of course he made sure to share all these discoveries with takeshi who made no additional comments on the subject as he wanted kintaro to figure out this state of being himself without more of an explanation with words and of course he had been improving in his abilities with the sword all this time as well 97 days after he began his meditation practice he had a fight against one of the most
(13:35) skilled masters in his dojo when he stepped up to begin the fight he did what he had been doing in every fight since he gained this new ability to let go and be present before every fight he said to himself reality is just this the energy of the present moment gave him strength and vitality he felt his feet firmly planted on the floor the bead of sweat run down his forehead and his chest expand and contract with his long deep breaths he no longer tried to analyze what his opponent would do first and instead followed the flow of his
(14:14) opponent's present movements by not trying to anticipate he anticipated everything he became one with the sword and after a few minutes of back and forth exchanges kintaro found a vulnerability in the swordmaster's attack and without even realizing what had happened the master found kintaro's wooden sword pointed at his neck kantaro had defeated the master and he had finally won the battle over the self that was created by his mind thank you guys very much for watching this short story written by me i hope

(01:44) you busy yourself with solutions for a problem you have not yet encountered or perhaps might not encounter this type of thought pattern is an example of unproductive thinking some examples of unproductive thinking are if I do this then this usually something negative will happen or why does this always happen to me unproductive thinking usually starts with fear hence it transforms into a loop of negative thoughts that serve to instill doubt when something goes wrong instead of wondering why ask how asking how shifts your focus on what can
(02:20) be done now and helps you be more productive it changes your perspective and helps you focus on what can be done number three schedules some self-reflection time sitting in a stew of your own problems is not productive it is time consuming and never yields positive results however making time to reflect can help you see and think about things from a different perspective it affords you time to assess pitfalls in your plans and how you can do better it also serves as a mental boundary if something goes wrong Your Instinct
(02:55) may be to run through and see where you failed however having a set time to go through and assess what went wrong prevents you from making hasty decisions number four change lanes did you know sometimes your brain practices reverse psychology on you the more you tell yourself not to do something the more you might find yourself doing it the same goes for overthinking whenever you find yourself overthinking it's always a good thing to try and get out of your head it surely can be a scary place sometimes by distracting yourself with for example

(04:01) perspective and gives you a new approach number six learn mindfulness does it feel like you run on autopilot when you spend most of the time racing in your brain it leaves you feeling less aware your surroundings take a back seat when your thoughts ride shotgun achieving mindfulness does not occur overnight it requires practice there are many books apps and courses and other resources that can help you become more mindful practicing mindfulness is a great way to ground yourself in the present you will be fully attending to what's
(04:36) happening to what you're doing to the space you're moving through by practicing mindfulness over time you will notice that you overthink a bit less number seven do away with perfectionism perfectionism can be a sign of lingering fears and it often leads to overthinking you become perceptive of your actions and how others might perceive them perfectionism Narrows the scope of your actions your thoughts and your future it renders you unproductive and incapable of moving past your problems or failures when you find yourself wanting to be
(05:11) perfect and start to overthink things remind yourself that done is better than perfect number eight accept your best are you always pushing yourself to cover that extra mile do you ever give yourself a break practicing compassion helps you move past your mistakes and let go when you become attuned to your emotions and they're accompanying physiological cues you can spot when you need to take a break by acknowledging your feelings that arise during that moment and saying positive affirmations you can encourage compassion for

Are you an overthinker? If your response isn’t an immediate no, then the answer is probably yes.

Recent research1https://news.umich.edu/most-women-think-too-much-overthinkers-often-drink-too-much/indicates that 73% of 25-35 year-olds and 52% of 45-55 year-olds overthink!

So… most of us are overthinkers.

And here’s the problem: Overthinking drains us, causes burnout, contributes to severe depression and anxiety, and is linked to increased alcohol and drug abuse.

Phew! What a list! And for those living with the effects of one or more of these challenges, trying to change can feel like a Herculean feat.

Thankfully, there have been recent developments in the study of overthinking research and management techniques that make addressing overthinking a manageable task.

Science of People was lucky enough to dive into the topic with author Jon Acuff in our video below!

Overthinking is when you think about something too much or for too long. It’s when you focus on the same thought patterns that feel trapping. Overthinking is when what you think gets in the way of what you want. When we overthink, we tend to get stuck in a negative thought loop, called rumination, instead of taking action.

This causes us to be stressed and waste our time, and it can even cripple our ability to make logical decisions. It can be hard to quiet your mind when you’re feeling anxious or stressed, and overthinking both feeds and feeds on those feelings.

Even worse, research2https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26158958/shows that overthinking doesn’t just cause insomnia. Overthinking is linked to:

Overthinking is caused by many factors, such as social expectations, relationship anxiety, and past trauma. Here are some more examples of overthinking:

Overthinking was actually developed as a survival mechanism for our ancestors. Those who were able to predict where and how danger might occur and how to avoid it managed to live longer.

We are far less likely to face life-threatening situations on a regular basis today. But at a primal level, there is a neurological connection3https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3273616/between physical pain and social, economic, or any number of other modern-day threats.

So why do you overthink? Because every morning, your brain wakes up and is on the lookout for a saber tooth tiger in the form of a sarcastic comment from your spouse, a frustrated sigh from your boss, or the person who cuts you off in traffic.

There are several types of people who are particularly vulnerable to overthinking: the shy type, the insecure type, and highly sensitive people.

The shy typeconstantly thinks about people. He lies in bed at night, replaying every conversation or interaction from the day. He’s worried about what others think of him and whether or not he made a good first impression after meeting new people. He often has anticipation anxiety, and his biggest fears often revolve around public speaking.

The insecure type, on the other hand, worries about her circumstances. She has sleepless nights agonizing about all of her decisions from the day… and possible decisions for tomorrow.

She might have low self-esteem because she’s underperforming at her job or constantly worries about her finances or health. If someone tells her something negative, she takes it personally, and that comment will linger in her head for far too long.

Highly sensitive peoplecan include both types of people above. They have increased sensitivity in their central nervous system with emotional, physical, or social stimuli.

They tend to have stronger emotional reactions, more compassion, and greater sensitivity to criticism, to name a few.

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to just think about something rather than overthink something? Let’s look at some examples of when thinking becomes overthinking.

Thinking:List the pros and cons of a new car you want to buy.

Overthinking: Analyzing the pros and cons of five different cars, three of which you’re not interested in but want to have as reference points.

Thinking: Reflecting on an uncomfortable conversation with your boss to determine how to improve and learn from the experience.

Overthinking: Rehashing the conversation word for word, feeling guilty and ashamed, and being unable to let go of anything you think you could have said differently.

Thinking: Planning where you’d like your career to go and setting goals to get there.

Overthinking: Obsessing over all the obstacles that could stop your career from moving forward and feeling anxious and overwhelmed.

Generally, thinkers will evaluate the past and the future in order to make rational decisions on how to move forward. At the same time, overthinkers will think about the same things over and over with little progress or decision.

Being able to recognize when you’re in a pattern of overthinking is the first step to being able to address it. It can be hard to identify because it can often masquerade as problem-solving or planning. Overthinking is often associated with thoughts becoming repetitive, obsessive, or negative. It is also tied to feelings of anxiousness, irritability, or exhaustion.

Overthinking could make you feel like you’re losing control of your emotions and actions, but that’s not true. You’re still in charge, even if it doesn’t feel like it at first.

Here’s the good news: Once you know what you’re thinking about, you can change it by challenging negative thoughts, setting realistic expectations, and practicing self-compassion.

Here’s a thought experiment for you:

Try not to think of a white polar bear.

Seems impossible, right?

But that’s exactly what participants did in Harvard professor Daniel Wegner’s famous”White Bear” experiment. In the experiment, Wegner asked students to verbalize their thoughts for 5 minutes while trying not to think of a white bear.

The surprising result? Students, on average, were pretty bad at not thinking of a white bear and thought of it at an average of more than once per minute!

Wegner even found that students who were told to suppress the idea of a white bear did worse than students who weren’t told to suppress their thoughts. You can watch the fascinating study here (timestamp 1:37):

Wegner’s remarkable study tells us it’s almost impossible to suppress unwanted thoughts. And trying to do so might end up causing us more harm than good. So instead, focus on releasing your unwanted thoughts.

While it may sound counterintuitive, research shows that trying to suppress unpleasant thoughts4https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3931447/actuallyincreasestheir recurrence long-term.

What thoughts are you suppressing?

First, just think of your unwanted thoughts. If we can’t control overthinking, let’s give it the attention it deserves.

Set a timer for 5 or 10 minutes and allow yourself to think.

Think of your problems and why they’re bothering you so much. Allow yourself ample time to think. Don’t push them away. What is your mind telling you? What are you worried about? Go deep.

Mindfulness is the practice of being highly aware of your senses and feeling in the moment without interpreting or judging. While mindfulness has been practiced for centuries in forms like meditation and Tai Chi, the rigorous scientific study of mindfulness is still fairly new.

One study5https://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/07-08/ce-cornerasked novice meditators to attend a 10-day retreat. By the end, participants reported less rumination (overthinking!) than the control group and performed better on memory and performance tasks.

Research also indicates6https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016643281830322Xthat mindfulness increases in value over time. The study showed improvements in mood, emotion, and memory for participants who practiced meditation for 13 minutes a day for eight weeks.

Try some of these to break the cycle of overthinking:

Grab a pen and paper and set a timer for 10 minutes. Start transferring everything down from your mind to your paper. List all the things you’ve been worried about so you have a place you can visualize them. Don’t worry about making it pretty—the point is to just get it down on paper. Give it your all!

Now, when the timer’s up, take a look at your list. How do you feel? Does it feel relieving to get all your unwanted thoughts down on paper?

Finally, here’s the fun part: crumple up that paper ball and throw it in the trash can.

The physical “throwing away” of your problems is a great technique to help you “feel” as if your worrying thoughts are gone. I find this helps if I’m stuck with something that’s been bothering me for days.

Following the news can be overwhelming and stressful, especially for overthinkers who internalize problems out of their control. Try spending several weeks without watching or reading the news.

Turn off notifications from news apps on your phone, or delete them entirely for a time. You can change your car preset radio station to classical music. You may even consider taking a break from social media, which can often contain stressful and overwhelming news.

If removing yourself entirely from news doesn’t appeal to you, try switching out your regular news app for one that focuses on positive stories, likeGood News. Want something to watch? TryThe Good News Showor other uplifting programs likeRandom ActsorQueer Eye.

Take time to consider how your view of the world changes as the content you consume changes.

CBT is a type of therapy that includes identifying troubling situations in your life, becoming aware of your thoughts, beliefs, and emotions, then identifying and reshaping negative or inaccurate thinking. CBT is one of many forms of therapy used to treat the root causes of overthinking, such as depression and anxiety.

A licensed therapist can offer professional help and answer questions you have about therapy.

Do you have a hard case of impostor syndrome?

Impostor syndrome is a phenomenon that makes you feel like you aren’t good enough:

No matter how successful someone is on the outside or how much external evidence there is of their skills or competence, people with impostor syndrome are convinced that they don’t deserve the success they have achieved. They may have pervasive thoughts about their incompetence or inferiority.

It’s even estimated7https://so06.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/IJBS/article/view/521that a whopping 70% of people suffer fromimpostor syndrome.

Impostor syndrome isn’t easy to combat, but here’s a great exercise…

When you catch yourself with negative internal dialogue, reframe your comment to be an “I’m great” statement:

So if you’re in a constant negativity loop, keep repeating to yourself, “I’m great.” Make it a daily habit. Stick Post-it notes on your bathroom mirror. Save your favorite quote on your desktop wallpaper.

Positive self-talk works because it replaces your negative self-talk. In Wegner’s experiment, students who were told to think of another object—a red convertible—instead of the white bear did rather well in focusing their thoughts.

In the same vein, try replacing your unwanted thoughts with positive ones. Being positive overall, according toMayo Clinic, can:

You know that feeling when a friend tells you that jacket looks great on you, or a co-working exclaims, “You’re amazing. I couldn’t have done this without you!

Those are positive affirmations; we all love hearing them from people around us. But did you know that when you offer yourself positive affirmations, you can rewire your brain8https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4814782/to challenge negative self-talk and increase self-esteem over time?

Here are some examples of positive affirmations:

Allow yourself time to clear your head by going on a brief walk. Research has concluded that even a 10-minute brisk walk9https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6064756/will improve one’s mood to a similar degree as meditating would.

Leave your phone at home and notice things around you on your stroll. What is the weather like? Is the area urban or rural? Are there other people around? Other animals? What season are the plants in? Can you find a beautiful flower to admire?

I recently found myself sitting at my desk looking at an email that made me mad. There was nothing particularly offensive about the email, but I felt lousy when I read it and thought about the situation.

I pulled out a notebook and began writing everything I was feeling. At the end of the page, I stopped, read what I’d written, and felt like there was still more behind my reaction, so I turned the page and kept writing. Ten minutes later, I was staring at a piece of paper that had nothing at all to do with the situation in the email but was the core of why I was upset.

When you can feel yourself reacting to something, take time to write it out. You can choose to combine this with the paper ball technique or not.

Another variation on positivity reframing, try keeping a gratitude journal for one week. Write down things that make you happy, things you are grateful for, and what is going well in your life.

One way to manage overthinking is by setting and achieving attainable goals. Having successes to look back on can help reframe your mindset to be more positive and grounded. Check out how to set better goals:

Do you set the same goals over and over again? If you’re not achieving your goals – it’s not your fault!Let me show you the science-based goal-setting framework to help you achieve your biggest goals.

Think of all the successes you’ve had in the past. Perhaps you got promoted at a job, aced a speech, or did something kind for a friend. Failure to live up to your past successes can be another major cause of overthinking.

If you’re struggling to get something done because you’re afraid of not living up to your past, you MUST realize this is a different opportunity.

And to help that mindset shift, try saying “I will “:

The “I will” technique is especially helpful if you’re under pressure. Research shows that athletes who give themselves instructional self-talk have improved attention and perform better.

Instead of telling yourself, “I’m going to do well,” replace it with an instructional “I will” to conquer your overthinking tendencies.

When facing overwhelming thoughts, it can help to focus on one thing at a time, identify the problem, and ask yourself if you can do anything about it. If the answer is yes, take action. If the answer is no, accept that as a reality and move on.

For example, an overthinking loop might sound like this: “It’s so late, and there’s so much to do, and I haven’t sent all the emails I need to, but it’s too late now, but I have to get it done…”

This can be broken down to “What actually needs to get done right now? The emails can wait until tomorrow, but I have to get the review done before the end of the day. It’s getting late, so I’m going to stop sending emails and focus on the review.

“Then I’m going make a note to myself of the emails that still need to go out tomorrow. I’ll put that on my desk and work on those first thing. And maybe I’ll go grab a snack first since I haven’t eaten in a while”.

If you were given a pill to totally get rid of your fears, would you take it?

You probably realize that’s a bad idea since we NEED fear to avoid doing reckless things, like walking in the middle of a busy highway or ostracizing all our friends.

So let’s work with fear.

The idea isn’t to totally get rid of your fears. When you start anything new or go through something potentially life-changing, there will always be fear.

Fear gets a voice, not a vote.

And we may never get rid of our fears—but that’s a good thing! You can learn to overcome your fears and become a Fear Boss.

How do we do that? To be a Fear Boss, we have to manage our fear rather than conquer it. Learn how in our article here:How to Overcome Fear and Conquer Self-Doubt.

If the environment you’re in isn’t working for you, shake things up!

Does the photo on your wall remind you how long it’s been since you went on vacation? Switch it out for a picture from the last dinner you went to with friends.

Are you anxious when you see your messy desk? Take a break and clean it off.

Looking for some inspiration? Put up a poster for the race you’re training for in your bathroom.

Find ways to make your environment work for you, whether that’s offering a fresh perspective, providing some light distraction, allowing a place to relax, or being inspiring.

One of the most frustrating parts of overthinking can be the feeling that no matter how much you think, you keep coming around to the same questions that don’t offer satisfactory answers.

In his bookQuestions Are The Answer, MIT Professor Hal Gregersen interviewed hundreds of creative thinkers to learn how to ask questions that provide breakthrough discoveries.

Changing the way you view questions, their role, and purpose can open up new opportunities for seeing questions as something to discover and enjoy rather than dreading the fear of an endless, unsatisfying loop.

Parkinson’s Law states that “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.”

In other words, if you give yourself a week to finish an assignment that could be done in a day… you’ll likely take the whole week to finish. It’s just human nature.

Parkinson’s Law also applies to overthinking. When we give ourselves too much time to think or complete a goal, it often delays our decision-making.

The good news is it also works the other way around. This is where Parkinson’s Deadline comes in:

“Work shrinks so as to meet the deadline when it’s due.”

If you’ve got a project due in a day that would normally take you a week, you’re much more likely to finish it. Even though it might not be as pretty, the important thing is you’ve finished it.

There are several common traps for overthinkers, most of which we’ve already touched on in some form or another.

Catastrophizing:that worst-case scenario you play in your head that could range from getting fired for a single mistake to the entire western United States being buried in lava when a supervolcano erupts.

Solution: Challenge the thought by considering the most realistic outcome instead.

Analysis Paralysis:getting stuck in a mental habit of analysis and indecisive behavior, leading to missed opportunities and procrastination.

Solution: Set a time limit for making the decision.

Negative Self-Talk:a constant internal dialog of criticism, shortcomings, and mistakes.

Solution:practice self-compassion and reframe negative thoughts for realistic or positive ones.

Perfectionism:Setting impossibly high standards for yourself and obsessing over tiny details and flaws.

Solution:Practice setting and obtaining realistic goals, focus on progress and celebrate small wins. See mistakes as part of a learning process.

Overthinking can be an exhausting experience! Remember, your brain goes out every morning trying to protect you from the same life-threatening dangers your ancestors faced and had to overcome to survive.

Thoughts that are repetitive, obsessive, or negative can be an indicator you are overthinking, but thankfully, there are ways to overcome the negative cycle.

Try some of the suggestions above, like practicing mindfulness, reducing your access to negative news reports, and keeping a gratitude journal.

Overthinking refers to dwelling on certain thoughts or constantly anticipating a situation or its possible outcome. Grounding exercises, stepping into action, and finding support from a mental health professional can help you to stop overthinking.

You finally have a few quiet moments to yourself, only to immediately start wondering if you forgot to send that thank-you email or whether you’ve overestimated your chances of getting the promotion.

Sound familiar? Worrying and overthinking are part of the human experience, but when left unchecked, they can take a toll on your well-being. Dwelling on the same thoughts may even increase your risk of certain mental health conditions.

So, what’s an overthinking person to do? These tips can help you move in the right direction.

The way you respond to your thoughts can sometimes keep you in a cycle ofrumination, or repetitive thinking. Rumination can often causenegative consequencesto a person’s mental health.

The next time you find yourself continuously running things over in your mind, take note of how it affects your mood. Do you feel irritated, nervous, or guilty? What’s the primary emotion behind your thoughts?

Having self-awareness is key to changing your mindset.

You can decrease overthinking by engaging in activities you enjoy. This may look different for everyone, but some ideas include:

It may be hard to start something new when you’re overwhelmed by your thoughts. If finding a distraction feels daunting, try setting aside a small chunk of time — say, 30 minutes — every other day. Use this time to explore potential distractions or dabble in existing ones.

The next time you find yourself tossing and turning over your thoughts, try closing your eyes andbreathing deeply. Respiration has a direct effect on your body and mind, and may help distract you and reduce the physical effects of overthinking.

Here’s a good starter exercise to help you unwind with your breath:

Try doing this exercise 3 times a day for 5 minutes, or whenever you have racing thoughts.

Developing a regular meditation practice is anevidence-backedway to turn your attention inward and clear your mind of nervous chatter.

All you need is 5 minutes every day and a quiet spot. More than one meditation technique exists. You can try a few ones until you find one that helps you quiet your mind.

Read more aboutmeditation techniques.

Trying to gain perspective may help you reduce overthinking about non-urgent matters. How will all the problems floating around in your mind affect you 5 or 10 years from now? Will anyone really care that you bought a fruit plate for the potluck instead of baking a pie from scratch?

Prioritizing the more serious challenges and letting go of everyday hurdles may help you feel less overwhelmed.

Helping others may bring you out of your own thoughts. Consider thinking of ways you can be of service to someone going through a difficult time. Does your friend who’s going through a divorce need a few hours of child care? Can you pick up groceries for your neighbor who’s been sick?

Realizing you have the power to make someone’s day better can keep negative thoughts from taking over. It also gives you something different to focus on instead of your stream of thoughts.

Automatic negative thoughts (ANTs)refer to knee-jerk negative thoughts, usually involving fear or anger.

You can identify and work through your ANTs by keeping a record of your thoughts and actively working to change them:

When you’re in the midst of overthinking, try jotting down five things that have experienced in the past week and your role in them.

These don’t need to be huge accomplishments. Maybe you stuck to your coffee budget this week or cleaned out your car. When you look at it on paper or on-screen, you might be surprised at how these little things add up.

If it feels helpful, refer back to this list when you find your thoughts spiraling.

Not ready to commit to a meditation routine? There are plenty of other ways to ground yourself in the present moment.

Here are a few ideas:

Sometimes, quieting your thoughts requires stepping outside of your usual perspective. How you see the world is shaped by your life experiences, values, and assumptions. Imagining things from a different point of view can help you work through some of the noise.

Try to jot down some of the thoughts swirling around in your head and investigate how valid each one is.

For example, maybe you’re distressed about an upcoming trip because you feel you won’t have time to arrange everything. But, is that really what’s going to happen? What kind of proof do you have to back that up? What happens if some things don’t get done in time? Is there someone else who can help you with non-urgent stuff?

Sometimes, you might go over the same thoughts repeatedly because you have not taken any concrete actions yet.

Try to ground your thoughts into things you can manage and do. Having an action plan can help you find relief.

Dwelling on past mistakes keeps you from letting go. If you’re concerned over something you did last week, try refocusing onself-compassion.

Here are some ways to get you started:

Some things will always be out of your control. Learning to accept this can go a long way toward curbing overthinking. Astudy from 2018shows that accepting negative thoughts and fears can help improve psychological health.

Of course, this is easier said than done, and it won’t happen overnight. But try looking for small opportunities where you can confront the situations you frequently worry about.

You’re not alone, and support is available if you find yourself overwhelmed. Seeking support from a trusted friend or family relative, or a qualified therapist can help you develop new tools for working through your thoughts and even changing your mindset.

Read abouthow to find a therapist that is right for you.

Overthinking things may often cause distress. You can reduce overthinking and rumination by breathing deeply, doing grounding exercises, practicing meditation, jotting down thoughts and breaking them into actionable steps, and focusing on your successes.

If you feel persistently overwhelmed by your thoughts or can’t stop overthinking, consider talking with a mental health professional who can help you develop coping skills.

(00:00) today we're going to show you how to teach your body that stress is designed for life or death situations and not doing simple stuff like opening emails [Music] so let's start by understanding what our stress system was designed for so if you look at the animal kingdom through which we evolve like our stress system is designed for short term life or death situations so if we're like human beings in a jungle and we see a tiger that's what our stress system is designed for you can look at things like deer or
(00:38) Impala or even mice or snakes and all of these organisms have stress systems and they're designed for sort of immediate and severe threats the problem if you call it a problem it's kind of not really a problem right I think it's a win for the human race most of the time in society today we're not faced with life or death situations right like we're not we're pretty secure like we've got a place to sleep hopefully we have food and stuff like that and so what we tend to see is that our stress system is
(01:04) inappropriately activated the kinds of stress that we deal with today are more long-term so on the first of the month I'm already thinking about how am I going to pay my rent at the end of the month how am I going to find a job how am I going to find a partner what's going to happen with climate change what's going to happen with inflation so the stressors that we face today are more chronic and long-term and the problem is that our body has one system to deal with stress and that system is designed for short-term stress so in a
(01:33) weird way our body inappropriately activates our stress system to deal with these problems and this creates an even bigger issue so if you're stressed out you're probably sort of in this cycle of like okay I'm feeling stressed I'm feeling overwhelmed let me engage in avoidance behaviors to make the stress go away so I'm going to distract myself or things like that and then as I distract myself and engage in avoidance the problems that are causing me stress don't actually go away and so as those
(02:03) problems build up and build up and build up I start to feel even more overwhelmed and more stressed out and so the problems tend to pile up and then eventually you cross this very important threshold where your stress outweighs your feeling of overwhelming and then like at the last second you procrastinate to the last minute and then in a burst of stress driven activity you do something about your problem if you're ready to take the next step on your mental health Journey check out Dr K's guide it's an immersive
(02:31) resource that distills over 20 years of my experience laid out in a way that is tailored to your needs so if you're ready to better understand your mind and take control of it check out the link in the description below but your performance in that point isn't very good right you're kind of exhausted you're sort of stressed out you're doing everything all at once everything is rushed and then you end up kind of doing a crappy job anyway and then you beat yourself up and then the cycle just
(02:56) repeats itself so today we're going to teach y'all how to Short Circuit that entire process how to really understand how stress works so that you can optimally solve your problems so let's start by understanding how our body keeps stress in check so normally let's say I'm walking through the jungle and I see a tiger I start to run there's a burst of crh and then ACTH and then that leads to cortisol adrenaline gets activated as all these systems get activated I also have a physical component so since I'm running my heart
(03:26) starts beating really fast my blood pressure increases and then something really really interesting happens as all of these things activate and I start running away what I actually my body detects all of these things so there are these things called your carotid baroreceptors which are blood pressure sensors in your neck and this is kind of interesting you know in like in movies and stuff when there's like a ninja and they like choke someone out they're not actually cutting off their oxygen flow what they're actually doing is squeezing
(03:56) on both sides of your carotid Barrel receptors and this is what's really interesting when they squeeze on both sides of the Carotid Barrel receptors our body thinks oh my God the blood pressure is way too high our blood pressure is huge right because you're squeezing on those parts so it increases the pressure and as we increase the pressure there it actually causes our heart rate to slow down and our blood pressure to drop which causes people to pass out in the movies but if we sort of stop and think about that what we
(04:24) actually discover is this is the natural way that our body compensates with a high stress situation when our blood pressure goes up and our heart rate goes up our body recruits other things to slow our heart rate down to decrease our blood pressure and to stop the production of cortisol now the problem in today's world is that when we feel stressed out there is not that physical component right so we get cortisol release but we don't actually increase our heart rate we don't increase our blood pressure we don't start
(04:57) hyperventilating because we're not physically running away from it everything the other thing that happens when we physically run away from things is that we release endorphins and endorphins will help us literally relax so basically what happens in the natural world and through millions of years of evolution is any time my body gets stressed it automatically starts Parts the circuitry to de-stress endorphins parasympathetic nervous system activation and you'll kind of understand this if you go for a very brisk run like
(05:26) if you exercise a lot what does your body want to do afterward it wants to do absolutely nothing I'm going to sit down I need to relax you don't feel like doing anything you're not even mentally stressed you're just kind of vegging out and so this is the really interesting thing our stress system today does not recruit any of those things because we feel this chronic stress with no homeostatic activation there's no balancing of the stress response in today's world so interestingly enough if
(05:56) we want to actually de-stress what we need to do is recruit those systems so if you're feeling super stressed out about something what you need to do is the most vigorous exercise you can do for as short of a time period is you can kind of tolerate so we're not talking about 20 minutes a day we're not talking about wake up every day and exercise what we're talking about is literally if you are feeling stressed out try to run as if something a monster is chasing you and your life depends on it run as hard
(06:26) as you can for a short of a time period as you can like you don't have to run for a long time you could literally do a dead ass Sprint for like 90 seconds and if you you feel absolutely exhausted and you can't run 91 seconds then you're doing it right now this is the really interesting thing a lot of people may say does this mean that I need to exercise no so this is what's really cool so if you run it 50 of Your Capacity you do not shut off your stress system if you run it 70 of Your Capacity
(06:54) you shut off your stress system more if you run it 90 or 100 of your capacity that recruits the greatest shut off of your stress system so think about it very simply right so the more the harder you exercise and the more difficult your exercise is the more that it stresses your body the more that it stresses your body the more that your body has to compensate as soon as the stress ends to even release more and more endorphins and calm you down even more so the beautiful thing about this technique is that if you are not in shape if you are
(07:30) not used to exercising you will actually get a greater stress reduction than some someone who is in shape and the really cool thing about that is that once we shut off our stress system then something beautiful happens once we're no longer stressed out and our CRA a CRF level drops then you will stop engaging in avoidance behaviors your cravings for avoidance will literally go shut down or decrease because our body is using endorphins to shut off CRF production once we shut off CRF production our desire for Cravings distraction and
(08:05) avoidance actually decreases which then allows you makes it more easier to actually do the task that is stressing you out in the first place so if you're in a situation where the thought of opening up your email triggers a stress response or sending a message to someone or needing to cancel social plans if you're stressed out about that engage in as vigorous exercises you can for as long as you can it doesn't have to be long and then you'll start to slow down you'll start to stop avoiding things and
(08:35) and then you'll actually be able to focus on the task at hand and do something about it and the Beautiful Thing is as you do things about it your overall Global stress will start to get better because you have fewer things to be stressed out about so the problem in today's society is that our stress system gets inappropriately activated by mental tasks but our stress system is actually designed for physical survival and the beautiful thing is that the stress system has a built-in off switch the problem is the stresses that we feel
(09:06) deal with today don't actually shut off the off switch even if you think about completing the task what does that do to your stress level it's sort of a relief but you don't actually feel fully relaxed afterward and why is that it's because when you complete the mental task you're not recruiting the endorphin system you're not recruiting your parasympathetic nervous system you're not actually shutting off CRF production so as soon as we're done with our task what do we go back into we give in the
(09:33) Cravings so if you want to master your stress in today's society you've got to recruit your stress system in the right way so hopefully this is helpful give this a shot and kind of let us know does this work for you not work for you we'd love to hear from you so go ahead and comment like or subscribe foreign



Work-related stress can lead to decreased energy levels, difficulties performing, and tense relationships. But there are ways to manage it and prevent the effects.

Stress is a natural response to pressure. While it’s not possible to eliminate all stress from your life, you can learn to cope with it and manage your reactions to stressful situations.

One effective way to deal with stress at work is to manage stressors immediately instead of letting situations escalate.

Although this isn’t always possible because some things may be out of your control, consider exploring which tips you may be able to implement in your work conditions.

If possible, consider taking a break or taking distance from the source of your immediate stress at your workplace.

If you can’t leave your place of work, consider:

Although moving around or leaving the place isn’t possible in every work environment, consider ways you can take a mental break. For example, taking a minute to focus on an object nearby and trying to identify as many details of it as possible.

As soon as your stress rises, try a deep breathing exercise.

Researchhas indicated that breathing techniques can benefit your physical and mental well-being, relieving stress and tension in the moment.

Because breathing is something you can easily do in most places (including a restroom cubicle if needed), consider relying on it as often as you can.

Several breathing exercises can help youcalm down quickly, such as:

Science backs up themental health benefits of journaling. Research, such as a2021 study, suggests that journaling can be used to relieve stress on any occasion.

Journaling can be as simple as setting a 5-minute timer and scribbling out your frustrations and worries. If you’re unsure what to write, consider ajournal prompt.

You can journal on your phone, computer, or on pen and paper.

Daily exercise canbenefit your mental health.

Research from 2017found that exercise can affect the parts of the brain responsible forregulating your moodand coping with stress.

In fact, all physical activity can boost feel-good hormones such asendorphins, dopamine, andserotonin.

If you can’t exercise regularly, try to stretch in your sitting spot, take walks before, during, or after work, or go up and down the stairs if you can.

Heading outside might also bring you some stress relief. A2019 studyconcluded that spending 20 minutes outdoors, even if just sitting down, is an effective way to reduce stress.

During your workday, that might look like walking to work, eating lunch outdoors, or spending time at the park after work.

Looking out a window for 5 minutes to focus on the sky, trees, birds, lights, or anything else you can look at, may also help you manage stress at work.

A2021 studyshowed that listening to music for 10 minutes, regardless of the environment, lowers cortisol levels and improves your mood, particularly when it’s your favorite type of music.

Consider searching for music that you can listen to while you work, or, on stressful days, try to listen to your favorite tunes while going to and back from work and during your breaks.

According to theNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), meditation is an effective way to achieve mental and physical relaxation.

Meditation doesn’t have to take a whole hour. You can practice short versions of your favorite meditation at your desk or during a restroom break.

For example, you can focus on your breath for 1 minute and then mentally repeat apositive affirmationfor 3 minutes. You could also write down this affirmation on a Word document and focus on the screen for a few minutes while you read it in your mind.

Dealing with stress at work may be easier if you anticipate it, particularly if your work environment isn’t supportive. One way of doing this is to grow your stress management toolkit.

When you feel stressed, you may havetrouble sleeping. But not sleeping enough may increase those stress levels.

A lack of sleep may also make it more difficult to focus and perform at work.

To better deal with job-related stress, consider maintainingoptimal sleep hygiene. If you’re living with a condition that affects your sleep patterns, consider reaching out to a health professional forsleep management options.

Identifying your stressors can help you anticipate them, making long-term stress management an easier task.

For example, if deadlines increase your stress levels, you might need to ask for longer lead times or start earlier. If you don’t have enough time to execute all your duties, you might want to automate certain tasks.

If this isn’t possible at your workplace, try to spend some time reflecting on this outside of work.

Consider writing a list of all the things that typically cause you a great deal of stress at work. Next to each, try to write at least two possible ways to manage those stressors ahead of time.

If you’re overwhelmed at work, it might be wise to forgo extra responsibility if possible. You could also let go of voluntary roles that cause you stress without bringing you any joy or opportunities.

Try to focus on your “big yes.” That is, those things you want to say yes to because they’re your key responsibility or they bring you great joy. Then, if possible, considersaying “no”to anything else that comes your way that doesn’t fit these two characteristics.

You might find it helpful toset boundaries at work. These boundaries can establish:

If this isn’t possible at work, consider doing it in your private life to avoid adding more pressure to your days. If setting your own ground rules isn’t possible, try to rely onrelaxation techniqueson your own time to compensate for some of the stress this may cause you.

In some instances, you might find your workload reasonable, but you still have difficulty getting everything done.

In this case, you might want to exploretime management practicesthat could lead you to feel more in control.

Asking for help can be difficult but necessary if you want to handle stress in the workplace better.

Consider:

Learning tocommunicate effectivelyat work may help you reduce stressful situations if your culture allows it.

Many factors can make a work environment more stressful. These can be different for everyone and may be related to the type of job.

Performance anxietymay also lead you to experience higher stress levels in the workplace. Also, your company’s culture may affect how you feel.

Lowpsychological safetyis directly linked to higher stress and lower job satisfaction. Psych safety refers to the belief that you can be yourself, set boundaries, and speak up at work without facing punishment, rejection, or isolation.

Working in an environment, even if virtual, where you may have difficulty expressing yourself, taking breaks, working on your mental health, and getting social recognition and support may lead to higher chances of experiencing job-related stress.

Other possible stressors include:

Stress serves a purpose. It can help you stay alert and motivated. But prolonged stress may impact your mental health.

Considertalking with a mental health professionalif:

Therapy can help you develop coping mechanisms. It can also help you addressharmful thought patternsand give you a space to process and express your emotions.

It’s possible to deal with stress at work. By anticipating your stressors, practicing relaxation techniques, and managing your time, you can decrease some of the pressures that make you feel stressed out at work.

If you’re finding it hard to cope with stress at work, consider speaking with a mental health professional.

It’s Sunday night, and you’re winding down after a fun-filled weekend. Despite your good mood, feelings of stress start to creep in as you realize another workweek is about to begin. Sound familiar?

What you’re feeling is likely work stress, or the mental, physical and/or emotional strain you feel caused by your job. Work stress is common—64% of employed adults experienced work stress in 2019 and 2020, according to the American Psychological Association’s (APA) Stress in America survey[1]Stress in America 2020: A National Mental Health Crisis. American Psychological Association. Accessed 10/18/2022.. But that doesn’t mean workplace stress is unavoidable.

Below, learn how to identify work stress, how to deal with stress at work and what to do if the stress follows you home.

Work stress is the result of excessive pressure from your job, which typically stems from demands that don’t align with a worker’s abilities, little support from managers and co-workers and little control over workload, according to the World Health Organization.

Symptoms of short-term stress include tensed muscles and increased sweating, heart rate, breathing rate and blood pressure. Steven Pratt, M.D., senior medical director at Magellan Healthcare in Arizona, adds that you may also feel:

Long-term stress can lead to headaches, digestive issues, sleep disorders, worsenedasthma,depressionandanxiety.

“Some signs that you may be experiencing workplace stress include feeling less stressed before and after the work day, on weekends, holidays and days off, and feeling anticipatory stress on Sunday evenings about the next work week,” says Whitley Lassen, Psy.D., the mental health services clinical director at K Health in New York.

If your stress symptoms tend to spike when you’re at work or thinking about work, it’s likely work stress, whereas feelings of general anxiety and depression encompass more aspects of your life than solely work.

Everyone manages stress differently, so what might be stressful for you might not be stressful for your colleague, says Dr. Lassen. However, work stress is often caused by:

Work stress can bleed into other aspects of your life if it’s left unchecked. It’s common to become unable to separate your work and home lives or to find a balance between the two, says Dr. Lassen. Stressed workers may dwell on the projects that didn’t go well “rather than seeing the big picture,” and end up exhausted both emotionally and physically even after signing off for the day. “They may have negative, unhelpful, intrusive thoughts or an urge to work when they aren’t on the job that interferes with their personal life,” she adds.

Untreated stresscan also cause further physical, mental and behavioral symptoms. Research has linked work stress to:

Stress-induced apathy, irritability and depression can further affect a person’s ability to maintain healthy relationships, a healthy diet and an exercise regimen, says Dr. Pratt. “All of which can lead to worsening mental and physical health,” he says.

Employing techniques to stay physically and mentally healthy can alleviate stress and keep it at bay. Try these tips to tamp down workplace stress:

Identify your stressors.Write down what stresses you out during the workday and how you respond. Perhaps morning traffic makes you late and cranky from the start, or a noon meeting causes you to forgo lunch for chips instead. Whatever it is, jot it all down, then take time to reflect on how you might respond to each situation in a healthier way.

Practice relaxation techniques.Meditation, mindfulnessandgrounding techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, can help calm the mind and body. It helps to regularly practice these relaxation techniques so you can more easily use them when stressed.

Dr. Lassen recommends keeping a “toolbox” to use in moments of stress that can include words of self-affirmation, calming or joyful pictures and a journal to help write away any negative thoughts.

Set aside time for yourself.Make time to do things that you enjoy, such as spending quality time with friends and family and exploring new or existing hobbies, suggests Dr. Lassen. The APA discourages fighting stress with fast food, alcohol or other unhealthy alternatives.

Step away from work.Give yourself space to recharge by turning off notifications and not thinking about work while on vacation. If you work from home, Dr. Lassen suggests closing your office door and shutting your laptop to signal to yourself and others that you’re done working for the day.

Maintain a regular exercise routine.Dr. Pratt recommends setting aside 30 to 45 minutes for a walk during your workday. “It is ‘me time’ during the workday,” he says. “When I return to the office after a walk, I return to a project with new energy, and often, with new insights.”

Improve your sleeping habits.Adults should aim for seven to eight hours of sleep, per the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Sleep deficiency can cause impaired daily functioning, productivity, focus and judgment, as well as frustration, crankiness and worry— which can exacerbate workplace strain. The APA suggests limiting afternoon caffeine intake and nighttime screen use.

See a therapist.Talking with a therapistabout your specific work situation can help address the impact of work stress on your mental health, offer an outlet for your frustrations and provide productive and healthy coping mechanisms.

In addition to coping with workplace stress, you can also confront the root of the issue. To tackle those stressors, take steps to:

Adjust your approach.You may be able to diminish work stress by changing certain habits. Dr. Pratt suggests reorganizing your files and resources to be better suited to your working style if you struggle with deadlines, or maintaining a solid network of people who can provide childcare on short notice if last-minute scheduling is an issue.

Talk to your manager.If the stressors can’t be resolved on your own, work with your boss to address the issues and come up with solutions. It helps to present realistic and feasible suggestions of your own, suggests Dr. Pratt. He and the APA also note that employee health is linked to better productivity and lower turnover, so employers should want to work toward meaningful resolutions.

Build a support system.Share your experiences with your colleagues—they probably have experienced similar struggles—and see if you can work towards solutions together, such as with scheduling conflicts or mandatory overtime. Bringing family and friends into the conversation can also help you feel less isolated and open doors to additional mental health resources.

If you're currently working, you probably know what it feels like to be stressed on the job. A must-do project arrives without warning. Three emails stack up for each one you delete. Phones ring, meetings are scheduled, a coworker drops the ball on a shared assignment.

Imagine for a moment that your boss has emailed you about an unfinished assignment (a stressor). Your body and mind instantly respond, activating a physical reaction called the fight-or-flight response. Your heart beats faster, your breath quickens, and your muscles tense. At the same time you might say to yourself, "I'm going to get fired if I don't finish this." Then to manage your anxiety and negative self-talk, you work late into the night to complete the task.

Over the course of our evolutionary history, humans developed this coordinated fear response to protect against dangers in our environment. For example, a faster heart rate and tense muscles would help us escape from predators. In the modern era, fear continues to serve an important function. After all, the fight-or-flight response can provide the necessary energy to pull an all-nighter and keep your job.

But what happens if you encounter stressful experiences at work every day? Over time, chronic work stress can lead to a psychological syndrome known asburnout. Warning signs of burnout are overwhelming exhaustion, cynicism, and a sense of inefficacy. Certain work-related stressors are closely linked with burnout. Examples are having too much work or too little independence, inadequate pay, lack of community between coworkers, unfairness or disrespect, and a mismatch between workplace and personal values.

Long-term exposure to work-related stressors like these can affect mental health.Researchlinks burnout with symptoms of anxiety and depression. In some cases, this sets the stage for serious mental health problems. Indeed,one studyshows younger people who routinely face heavy workloads and extreme time pressure on the job are more likely to experience major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

High levels of stress at work –– and outside of it –– can affect physical health, too. Repeated activation of the fight-or-flight response can disrupt bodily systems and increase susceptibility to disease. For example, repeated release of the stress hormone cortisol can disturb the immune system, and raise the likelihood ofdeveloping autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Chronic stress can also affect health by interfering with healthy behaviors, such as exercise, balanced eating, and sleep.

Work stress can also harm companies or organizations. Burnout reduces job productivity and boosts absenteeism and job turnover, and also leads to conflict between coworkers, causing stress to spread within a workplace.

All of us can benefit by learning skills to manage fear and anxiety on the job. Several skills taught in cognitive behavioral therapy may help, including these:

Working on your time management skills, taking time to recharge, becoming aware of how events affect you, and relying on a support network may help you manage job-related stress. Asking for help is also important.

Emails, Slack messages, phones ringing off the hook, your co-worker dropping by for an impromptu meeting, deadlines — work-related stress can be a lot to handle.

Some tension is expected, especially when facing a looming presentation or challenging assignment. But when work stress becomes chronic, it can affect your physical and emotional well-being.

Experiencing work strain is unavoidable — even if you love what you do. You can take actionable steps to keep job stress at a manageable level.

Sometimes, it’s easy to underestimatehow much stress affects you. If you start becoming aware of how you feel, you may find yourself emotionally exhausted and pessimistic by the end of some days.

Long-term exposure to unmanaged stress can take a toll on your body and mental health, and recentresearchsuggests a potential link between work-relatedburnoutand depression and anxiety.

Here’s a look at some of the subtler signs of stress:

Identifying and recording stressful situations can help you understand what’s bothering you. Some of these can be subtle sources of tension, such as an uncomfortable workspace, chatter in the back, or along commute.

Keeping a journalto track your stress triggers and reactions may help. You can include people, places, and events that cause you a physical, mental, or emotional response.

As you write, you may ask yourself:

Taking even a few minutes of personal time during a busy day can help prevent burnout caused by chronic work stress.

Listening to an interesting podcast between meetings or watching a funny YouTube video can give you relaxing pauses throughout the day. The more relaxed you are, the more productive you can be.

It’s also important to take breaks from thinking about your job by not checking work-related emails on your time off or disconnecting from your phone in the evenings.

Here are more ways to recharge.

Sometimes, feeling overwhelmed by work comes down to how organized you are.

Try setting up a priority list at the beginning of your work week by preparing tasks and ranking them according to importance.

You can alsobeat procrastinationby setting aside specific time blocks for deep concentration work. Try to address the more tiresome or less appealing tasks for an early sense of relief that may make the rest of the day feel less stressful.

Being available around the clock will quickly burn you out. Creating clear boundaries between work and home life is essential to help you avoid potential job-related stress.

Part of this means setting aside time for socializing and establishing rules for when you’ll check emails or take phone calls.

When you’ve experienced worry and chronic stress for an extended period, your mind may tend to jump to conclusions and read into every situation with a negative lens.

For example, if your boss doesn’t say “hi” to you first thing in the morning, you might react by thinking, “They’re mad at me.”

Instead of making automatic judgments, try distancing yourself from negative thoughts and observing.

Keep in touch with trusted friends and family to help cope with stressful work situations.

If you’re having a hard time with an incredibly challenging work week, try asking parent friends if they can help carpool your kids to school on certain days.

Having people you can rely on during tough times can alleviate some of the built-up tension.

Setting aside time forself-careis necessary if you regularly feel overwhelmed by work. This means prioritizing sleep, setting aside time for fun, and ensuring you eat throughout the day.

Feel like you don’t have the time?Keep in mind that you’ll likely be able to tackle work issues more effectively when your core needs are being met.

Purposefully slowing down and being conscious of your surroundings can keep you relaxed throughout the week.Meditation,deep breathingexercises, andmindfulnesscalm stress and anxiety.

You may start by taking a few minutes each day to focus on being present and enjoying a simple activity — a short walk around the park or appreciating a meal at your desk.

You can also take a few seconds every hour to look out a window, listen to a favorite song, or eat a delicious snack. Remember to leave all work-related stuff aside when you take these breaks.

Here are a few other ways to build mindfulness into your daily routine:

Workplace conflict can take a significant toll on your emotional well-being. Try to avoid participating in gossipy situations.

If you know one of your colleagues is especially prone to gossip, find a way to spend less time with them or steer the conversation to safer topics.

Some other strategies for staying out of the fray include:

If you need to get that presentationjust rightor find yourself working extra hours perfecting a report you finished days ago, it may be time to take a step back and reflect.

Whileperfectionismhas some positive benefits, it can also be highly stressful and lead to burnout.

Try to keep your high standards in check by focusing on the effort you put into a project and not personalizing failure when you make a mistake.

Being able to disconnect or “switch off” from responsibilities and job-related activities can help you relax and unwind like no other.

You don’t have to jet-set across the world, either. A work-free staycation or trip a few hours out of town can help you reset.

Getting support from your boss can significantly alleviate feelings of burnout.

Try to set aside quiet time to talk with your manager and calmly discuss feeling overwhelmed by challenging tasks. Approach the conversation from a place of solving the problem rather than listing complaints.

For example, you could say you want to revisit what’s expected of you outside of working hours because things feel overwhelming. The point is to find a resolution that helps reduce strain.

If this task sounds daunting or you don’t have a good relationship with your boss, consider reaching out to someone in your company’s human resources department (if available). They can help you navigate the conversation and offer troubleshooting tips.

You don’t need to have a mental health condition to try therapy. Feeling overwhelmed at work is a valid reason to seek additional help and support.

Working with a mental health professional may help you better identify the sources of your work stress and find ways to navigate them.

A therapist may also help you develop strategies for decompressing and caring for yourself so you avoid burnout.

Not sure where to start? Our guide to therapy for every budget can help.

Work stress that goes unresolved may lead to emotional and mental challenges and decreased productivity.

Taking period pauses during the day, strengthening your support network, engaging in relaxation techniques, setting work-life boundaries, and asking for support from your boss or a therapist may help you manage job-related stress to avoid burnout.

What causes panic attacks, and how can you prevent them? - Cindy J. Aaronson - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0

Transcript:
(00:00) [Music] the body becomes its own corset past present and future exist as a single force a swing without gravity soars to a terrifying height the outlines of people and things dissolve countless poets and writers have tried to put words to the experience of a panic attack a sensation so overwhelming many people mistake it for a heart attack stroke or other life-threatening crisis though panic attacks don't cause long-term physical harm afterwards the fear of another attack can limit someone's daily life and cause more panic attacks studies
(00:47) suggest that almost a third of us will experience at least one panic attack in our lives and whether it's your first your hundredth or you're witnessing someone else go through one no one wants to repeat the experience even learning about them can be uncomfortable but it's necessary because the first step to preventing panic attacks is understanding them at its core a panic attack is an overreaction to the body's normal physiological response to the perception of danger this response starts with the amygdala
(01:19) the brain region involved in processing fear when the amygdala perceives danger it stimulates the sympathetic nervous system which triggers the release of adrenaline adrenaline prompts an increase in the heart and breathing rate to get blood and oxygen to the muscles of the arms and legs this also sends oxygen to the brain making it more alert and responsive during a panic attack this response is exaggerated well past what would be useful in a dangerous situation causing a racing heart heavy breathing or hyperventilation the
(01:55) changes to blood flow cause lightheadedness and numbness in the hands and feet a panic attack usually peaks within 10 minutes then the prefrontal cortex takes over from the amygdala and stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system this triggers the release of a hormone called acetylcholine that decreases the heart rate and gradually winds down the panic attack in a panic attack the body's perception of danger is enough to trigger the response we would have to a real threat and then some we don't know for sure why
(02:29) this happens but sometimes cues in the environment that remind us of traumatic past experience can trigger a panic attack panic attacks can be part of anxiety disorders like ptsd social anxiety disorder ocd and generalized anxiety disorder recurring panic attacks frequent worry about new attacks and behavioral changes to avoid panic attacks can lead to a diagnosis of a panic disorder the two main treatments for panic disorder are antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioral therapy or cbt both have about a 40 response rate
(03:09) though someone who responds to one may not respond to the other however antidepressant medications carry some side effects and 50 percent of people relapse when they stop taking them cbt meanwhile is more lasting with only a twenty percent relapse rate the goal of cbt treatment for panic disorder is to help people learn and practice concrete tools to exert physical and in turn mental control over the sensations and thoughts associated with a panic attack cbt begins with an explanation of the physiological causes of a panic attack
(03:45) followed by breath and muscle exercises designed to help people consciously control breathing patterns next comes cognitive restructuring which involves identifying and changing the thoughts that are common during attacks such as believing you'll stop breathing have a heart attack or die and replacing them with more accurate thoughts the next stage of treatment is exposure to the bodily sensations and situations that typically trigger a panic attack the goal is to change the belief through experience that these sensations and situations are
(04:20) dangerous even after cbt taking these steps isn't easy in the grip of an attack but with practice these tools can both prevent and de-escalate attacks and ultimately reduce the hold of panic on a person's life outside formal therapy many panickers find relief from the same beliefs cbt aims to instill that fear can't hurt you but holding on to it will escalate panic even if you've never had a panic attack understanding them will help you identify one in yourself or someone else and recognizing them is the first step
(05:00) in preventing them panic attacks can be a common symptom for those suffering from mental health disorders like ptsd and ocd so what causes ptsd and what does it mean to have ocd educate yourself with these videos



A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions when there is no real danger or apparent cause. Panic attacks can be very frightening. When panic attacks occur, you might think you're losing control, having a heart attack or even dying.

Many people have just one or two panic attacks in their lifetimes, and the problem goes away, perhaps when a stressful situation ends. But if you've had recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and spent long periods in constant fear of another attack, you may have a condition called panic disorder.

Although panic attacks themselves aren't life-threatening, they can be frightening and significantly affect your quality of life. But treatment can be very effective.

Panic attacks typically begin suddenly, without warning. They can strike at any time — when you're driving a car, at the mall, sound asleep or in the middle of a business meeting. You may have occasional panic attacks, or they may occur frequently.

Panic attacks have many variations, but symptoms usually peak within minutes. You may feel fatigued and worn out after a panic attack subsides.

Panic attacks typically include some of these signs or symptoms:

One of the worst things about panic attacks is the intense fear that you'll have another one. You may fear having panic attacks so much that you avoid certain situations where they may occur.

If you have panic attack symptoms, seek medical help as soon as possible. Panic attacks, while intensely uncomfortable, are not dangerous. But panic attacks are hard to manage on your own, and they may get worse without treatment.

Panic attack symptoms can also resemble symptoms of other serious health problems, such as a heart attack, so it's important to get evaluated by your primary care provider if you aren't sure what's causing your symptoms.

It's not known what causes panic attacks or panic disorder, but these factors may play a role:

Panic attacks may come on suddenly and without warning at first, but over time, they're usually triggered by certain situations.

Some research suggests that your body's natural fight-or-flight response to danger is involved in panic attacks. For example, if a grizzly bear came after you, your body would react instinctively. Your heart rate and breathing would speed up as your body prepared for a life-threatening situation. Many of the same reactions occur in a panic attack. But it's unknown why a panic attack occurs when there's no obvious danger present.

Symptoms of panic disorder often start in the late teens or early adulthood and affect more women than men.

Factors that may increase the risk of developing panic attacks or panic disorder include:

Left untreated, panic attacks and panic disorder can affect almost every area of your life. You may be so afraid of having more panic attacks that you live in a constant state of fear, ruining your quality of life.

Complications that panic attacks may cause or be linked to include:

For some people, panic disorder may include agoraphobia — avoiding places or situations that cause you anxiety because you fear being unable to escape or get help if you have a panic attack. Or you may become reliant on others to be with you in order to leave your home.

There's no sure way to prevent panic attacks or panic disorder. However, these recommendations may help.

You are sitting at home, watching a suspenseful movie. Out of the blue, your heart starts pounding. You feel like you can't breathe, your face gets hot, and your fingers start tingling. You've had these sensations before, and your mind goes back to a familiar thought:

I'm having a heart attack, and I'm dying!

However, you are still alive, and you are reading this article. It turns out it was another panic attack.

Panic attacks can be frightening, especially when they are unexpected. Suppose you have a panic attack before a test or before giving a speech or when you see police lights flashing in the car behind you. It still can be scary and extremely uncomfortable. However, thefearcan reach epic proportions when the attacks seemingly come from nowhere.

Knowing more about your triggers can help defuse some of youranxietyduring a panic attack and ultimately lead to overcoming them.

The fight-or-flight response is your body's reaction to danger. Having a powerful anxiety response can be helpful. If you were crossing the street, and a motorcycle came barreling towards you, you would need to have a quick reaction to get out of the way.

However, some people are prone to having an extreme stress response in situations that don't warrant it. When there is no outside stressor, people try to figure out the reason for their intense body sensations. They often think there is something physically (or mentally) wrong with them.

Biological and genetic factors make more people more prone to experiencing repeated panic attacks. Here are some other risk factors:

Sensations: High anxiety sensitivity:Research has shown that people with recurring panic attacks tend to have high anxiety sensitivity (fear of anxiety sensations). They pay too muchattentionto their bodies to ensure everything is OK.

It's normal to experience changes in body sensations throughout the day, and most people don't notice them. However, those with high anxiety sensitivity can misinterpret harmless body symptoms as dangerous and set off a panic attack.

Thoughts: Beliefs about the risk of physical and mental problems:Some people think they are at significant risk of physical or mental issues. For example, maybe they had a history of physical illness inchildhoodor lost a loved one to a heart attack. Or perhaps they have a relative with schizophrenia and worry that they might develop the disorder at some point. Or maybe they fainted and then became fearful of fainting.

Thus, someone feeling vulnerable in these ways might misinterpret anxiety or panic symptoms as a sign of having a heart attack, "going crazy," or fainting. People with these types of fears also tend to have high levels of anxiety sensitivity.

Situations: Fear of situations where previous attacks occurred:For those with recurring panic attacks, certain situations become associated with panic attacks. For example, someone might have been driving on the freeway on the way to a job interview, got anxious, and then had a panic attack. As a result, they might associate freeway driving with panic attacks and worry about losing control of the car and causing an accident. This fear might cause them to avoid driving on the freeway altogether.

Whenever I notice my heart beating fast or hear about someone having a heart attack, I think I'm going to have a heart attack.

When I can't concentrate on something, I worry that I'm losing my mind, which causes me to panic.

When I am in a situation where I feel like I cannot escape, like in the dentist's chair or a crowd, it causes me to have a panic attack.

Now that you have identified your triggers, here's how to use this information:

Sensations:If you notice uncomfortable body sensations, even if they seemingly come from out of nowhere, remind yourself that it is normal for this to occur. Also, tell yourself that you are likely to be hyper-aware of body sensations because you are vulnerable to panic attacks. You can also refer to aprevious postI wrote for additional steps to reduce body awareness.

Thoughts:Remind yourself of other times you have panicked, and your feared outcome didn't occur. For example, if you fear dying during an attack, ask yourself how many times you have had that thought and how many times you actually died. Panic attacks are not dangerous, even though they feel that way. If you have a health concern that you are worried about (e.g., heart attacks), talk to your doctor about it to alleviate your concerns.

Situations:If you are going into a situation that you associate with panic attacks, remind yourself in advance that you might get anxious and possibly panic. However, all panic attacks are temporary and not dangerous, and you will be OK. If you are tempted to avoid a situation that you associate with panic attacks, try to resist the urge. Avoidance only makes situations scarier. Coach yourself through the situation by telling yourself that panic attacks are not dangerous and every panic attack will end.

In sum, panic attacks feel scary and uncontrollable. However, the more you learn about your specific triggers, the more you will feel in control, which is an important step in conquering panic attacks.

I feel sad all the time, what can I do



Jordan Peterson's Advice For People With Depression - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlDgowUAyx4

Transcript:
(00:03) the first thing i would say is that if you're dealing with someone who's depressed and they're really depressed you should try giving them antidepressants because if they die you can't help them okay so if you're suffering you are obligated in a sense to hold on to whatever rope someone throws you and one of the things i do with my clients all the time especially if they're really in trouble is to tell them look i don't know exactly what's going to hap help you but don't arbitrarily throw out
(00:29) any possibilities because you might not have that luxury antidepressants help a lot of people and there are technical reasons why that's the case so that's a simple answer it's not relevant to what i already described except that if you're offered a gift by your society and it works try it i don't care what your presuppositions are apart from that lots of the lots of time lots of the time you see people who are suffering with depression for example there's a multitude of reasons but i'll take one
(01:01) common reason um you could think about it as associated with the story of peter pan a peter pan is someone who won't grow up right now the problem with peter pan is he gets to be king but it's king of neverland neverland doesn't exist so being king of nothing isn't that helpful well one of the things that you often see with people who suffer from depression and and i'm not making a blanket statement about the cause of depression because there's lots of them is that people who don't have enough
(01:27) order in their life tend to get overwhelmed so for example if someone comes into me and sees to see me and they say they're depressed i always ask them a very standard set of questions do you have a job if you don't have a job you're really in trouble in our society first of all you your biological rhythms tend to go off the rails right away because there's no reason to go to bed at any particular time and there's no reason to get up and for many people if they don't get up at the same time
(01:53) they follow up the functioning of their circadian rhythms and that's enough to make them depressed right off the bat especially if they start napping during the afternoon they don't also don't have a purpose people aren't good without a purpose and this isn't this isn't hypothesizing we absolutely understand the circuitry that underlies positive emotion we know how it works almost all the positive emotion that any of you are likely to experience in your life will not be a consequence of attaining things
(02:19) it will be a consequence of seeing that things are working as you proceed towards a goal you value that's completely different and you need to know this because people are often stunned for example they finish their phd thesis and their presupposition is that they're going to be elated for a month and often instead they're actually depressed and they think what the hell i've been working on this for seven years and i handed it in and what do i do now and that's what depresses them right it's
(02:43) the what do i do now well they're fine if they enjoyed it pursuing the thing as long as it was working out they get a lot of enthusiasm and excitement out of that because that's how our nervous systems work most of your positive emotion is goal pursuit emotion if you take drugs like cocaine or amphetamine the reason they're enjoyable is because they turn on the systems that help you pursue goals that's why people like them so if you don't have a job you got no structure that's not good plus you tend not to
(03:08) have a point so you're overwhelmed by chaotic lack of structure and you don't have any positive emotion well do you have any friends so sometimes you see people who are depressed they have no job they have no friends they have no intimate relationship they have an additional health problem and they have a drug and alcohol problem my experience has been if you have three of those problems it's almost impossible to help you you're so deeply mired in chaos that you can't get out because you make progress on one front and one
(03:36) of your other problems pulls you down so one of the things i tell people who are depressed is like don't sacrifice your stability get a job even if it's not the job you exactly want get a damn job you need a job find some friends get out in the dating circuit see if you can establish an intimate relationship put together some of the foundational items that that are like pillars that your life rests on well that's the practical thing to do so that's one example with regards to depression well the thing is you don't just launch
(04:12) it on them you know you've got to negotiate with the person and you also got to teach them to negotiate with themselves and this is something that's very useful to know you know um you can tyrannize yourself into doing things but i wouldn't recommend it what i would recommend instead is that you ask yourself what you're willing to do it's a really effective technique it's like a meditative technique so for example you can get up in the morning and you can think well you know i'd like to have
(04:34) a good day today so i'd like to go to bed tonight without feeling guilty because i you know didn't do some things i said i was going to do and i you know i'd like to have kind of an interesting day so you got to fulfill my responsibilities and i want to you know enjoy the day then you can ask yourself well okay what would i have to do in order for that to happen that i would do and the probability if you practice this for three or four days is your brain will just tell you'll say well you know
(04:56) there's that piece of homework that you haven't done for like three weeks you should knock that sucker off because it would only take you 10 minutes and you've been avoiding it and torturing yourself to death for you know like like 72 hours straight and if you do that here's a little interesting thing you can do and you know maybe this is little obligations you should clean up and so what what you do in a situation like that is you teach the person to negotiate with themselves say well let's figure out what your aims
(05:19) are you got to have some aims whatever they are and they might say well i'm so depressed i don't have any aims and then i say well pick the least objectionable of the aims and act it out for a while and see what happens because sometimes your emotions your emotional systems are so followed up that you have to pretend you have to act the thing out before you can start to believe it i mean people always assume they have to believe and then act but but that's sometimes that's true and lots of times it isn't
(05:43) so the trick if you're doing therapeutic work with somebody and you're helping them establish a structure is to find out what they'll do now if they want to get better which is not a given because there are often payoffs for not getting better that's basically the payoffs of being a martyr or maybe the payoffs of doing what your entirely pathological family members want you to do because they actually want you to fail assuming you want to get better there's usually something you can figure out that would
(06:10) constitute a step towards some sort of concrete goal and my presumption it's a behavioral presumption fundamentally is that small accruing gains that repeat are unbelievably powerful so you know and this is another thing to know about in your own life it's something i learned in part from reading the writings of alexander solzhenitsyn who's a great russian philosopher and novelist you know he said you can look at your life and you can see what isn't right about it i mean all you have to do is look
(06:38) and then you can start to fix that and the way you fix it is by noticing what you could in fact fix you know people are often trying to fix things they can't fix which i would not recommend because if you try to fix something you can't fix you'll just ruin it like you can find all sorts of undergraduates who are perfectly willing to restructure the uh you know the the international economic system who cannot keep their room clean and there's actually a gap there you know which and it's surprising that
(07:04) people don't actually notice so i would say if you pay attention you can see things that you could fix they yell at you they really do we even know how that happens let me let me give you an example because rooms are full of stories and the stories have have effects on you so here's a classic experiment so you take two groups undergraduates you bring them into your lab and you give one group on a multiple choice test that has a bunch of words in it that are associated with being old and you give the other group the same
(07:33) multiple choice test except the words are associated with being young this is independent of the content of the test it's just descriptions and then you time the undergraduates as they walk back to the elevators the ones who read the ones who completed the multiple choice tests that had more words associated with aging walk slower back to the elevators and they don't know that and they don't know they're doing it and that that study has been replicated in various forms many many times you're unbelievably
(07:58) sensitive to the story that your environment is telling you because your environment is not made out of objects that's just wrong your environment is basically made out of something like tools and obstacles you're a tool-using creature you're a tool perceiving creature the things you like if i take you out of this room and i say well what was in the room you're not going to say uh you know random patterns in the carpet because they're they're real they're just as good an object as anything else you're going to
(08:21) see chairs because you can sit on them and you're going to say hand rails because you can hold them you're going to say stairs because you can walk down them that's what you see and that's what you interact with and if you pay attention to your environment which is you by the way extend it all of your experience is you it will tell you all the time what you should do all you have to do is do it but then you have to decide if you want to do it one of the things i've noticed about people because i've wondered once i
(08:44) started studying these mythological stories and i got this idea about the the fact that life can be meaningful enough to justify its suffering i thought god that's such a good idea because it's not optimistic exactly you know some people tell you well you can be happy it's like those people are idiots i'm telling you they're idiots there's going to be things that come along that flatten you so hard you won't believe it and you're not happy then and so if life is to be happy well in those
(09:09) situations what are you doing why even live but that isn't life isn't to be happy if you're happy you're bloody fortunate and you should enjoy it you should because it's the grace of god so to speak with regards to to meaning i thought well people know when they're doing something meaningful they can tell so why the hell don't they do meaningful things all the time it seems obvious you could do it i mean it's hard you know because other people want you to do other things and it's a struggle
(09:35) but everything's a struggle and then i thought well oh i get it i see why it took me about 10 years to figure this out people have a choice choice number one nothing you do means anything well that's kind of a drag right meaninglessness of life and all that existential angst you know that's kind of a pain but the upside of nothing that you do be mean is meaningful is you don't have to do anything you've got no responsibility now you have to suffer because things are meaningless but that's a small price
(10:03) to pay for being able to be completely useless the alternative the alternative is everything you do matters really if you make a mistake it's a real mistake if you betray someone you tilt the world a little more sharply towards evil rather than good it matters what you do well if you buy that then you can have a meaningful life but there's no mucking around it means responsibility it means that the decisions you make are important it means that when you do something wrong it's wrong well do you want that

It’s increasingly common for someone to be diagnosed with a condition such as ADHD or autism as an adult. A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers.

What is sadness?

Sadness is defined as havinggrief, sorrow, or unhappiness. Sad feelings are also a part ofdepressionand related to other parts of depression including poorself-worth, poor sleep, and difficulty enjoying things.

Although we can sometimes get caught in our sad feelings, we don't have to. We can undo sadness and start growing ourhappinessand well-being (take thiswell-being quizto start). Here are some ways to deal with sad feelings.

Ruminationis when you get stuck in your head, thinking about all the negative stuff that has gone wrong or could go wrong. Rumination is a key feature of depression and contributes to so much unnecessary sad feelings. That's why beating rumination is an important first step to getting through sadness.

To stop the rumination, try engaging your body in some activity that is intense enough that you can't think for a few minutes. For example, you could do sprints or take an ice-cold shower. This shock can stop your brain from cycling and force it to focus on the present moment.

If something has happened to us to make us sad, we might become sadness-prone—only thinking about the worst things that could happen. It's common because we feel like if we think through these bad outcomes, we can better prepare. But it just makes us feel worse in the long run. Our sadness can snowball into feeling all sorts of other negative emotions.

So try to imagine a brighter future, even if only in an exercise to help your brain break through sad feelings. Here's an exercise toimagine future happiness.

Mindfulnessinvolvesself-reflectionto gain awareness and acceptance of thoughts and emotions. Mindfulness can undonegative thinkingstyles that generate excess sadness.

To practice this skill, pause, payattentionto your negative emotions and attempt to approach them with curiosity instead of judgment.

Reappraisalis anemotion regulationstrategy that we can use to reinterpret a sad situation in a more positive (or less negative) way. Reappraisal is hard for many of us, and if we have a hard time seeing the silver linings, this can contribute to higher levels of sadness and depression.

Luckily, we can get better at reappraisal. We just have to practice thinking about what’s good in the situation. What are yougratefulfor, how could it have gone worse, or what small things are actually good? By using reappraisal, you can stop sad feelings.

There are so many science-based strategies you can use to undo sadness. By readingself-helpbooks, you can begin to learn and implement these strategies into your life.

So grab somehigh-quality self-help booksor take anonline program to boost happinessand learn the skills you need to decrease your sad feelings.

Low serotonin is linked to depression. So how might you increase serotonin?

One quick way is to eat carbohydrates. Yeah, it turns out that the warm fuzzy feeling we get when we eat carbs is in part due to the serotonin boost we get from them. Another way to boost serotonin is to (carefully) take 5-HTP supplements, which help increase serotonin in the body. And aerobic exercise, in particular, may contribute to higher levels of serotonin.

I was super surprised to discover greater sugar intake is linked to higher levels of depression. We already knew sugar we bad for our physical health, but it turns out to be bad for our mental health, too. So try not to consume so much sugar if you're struggling with sad feelings.

Feeling sad sucks. But we can't allow ourselves to obsess about it. If we focus too much on our lack of happiness and worry about being stuck in sadness, we just make things worse. So try to focus on actions you can take and things you can do to feel better, rather than focusing specifically on your sad feelings.

Positive emotions broaden our thought processes and build on themselves, creating a lifeline to us when we're stuck in sadness. That’s why doing things to create more positive emotions is so important for reducing our sadness.

There are so many ways to create positive emotions. In many ways, this may be easier than decreasing the negative emotions directly. For example, you can improve your ability tothink positivelyorpractice gratitude. You can also do things you enjoy, like spending time with friends, going outside, or reading. Whatever makes you happy, do these things.

We’re on our phones 24-7. But spending too much time on our phones or the internet is associated with higher levels of depression andloneliness. So you need to learn how to "outsmart your smartphone" anduse our phones in ways that increase happiness instead of sadness.

Challenging self-critical thoughts and beingself-compassionatecan help reduce negative emotions like sadness. So if you’re being really hard on yourself, trythinking about your good qualitiesand strengths.

​There are many actions you can take to beat sadness, making a "happiness plan" can be helpful. For example, you could do one new sadness-busting strategy each day. Whatever works for you to ensure you'll do the things that make you feel better is what matters most.

6 differences between sadness and depression

12 things to do when you are sad to feel better

3 signs to look out for

Reclaiming the sunshine

Building strong coping strategies helps you heal and brings you the resilience you need to work through big feelings.

But sometimes, you don’t know what tools you need until you need them. Maybe your usual methods of thwartingsadnessaren't doing enough to lessen the emotional weight, or you’rementally exhaustedand can’t muster the energy to reflect and heal.

Everyone experiences sadness, but knowing what to do when you’re sad makes all the difference in moving on and learninghow to copeand when to reach out for help. This understanding helps channel your emotions intoself-care, fostering a sense of well-being and, ideally, peace.

Sadness is normal. But when it becomes so extreme or constant that it affects your life negatively, it might signal a larger mental health issue like depression.

According to a review from Medical News Today,sadness isn’t classified as a psychiatric disorder because it passes with time. It usually stems from specific events, like a romantic breakup or theloss of a loved one. On the other hand, clinical depression is a diagnosable mental disorder unrelated to specific events, with sadness as one of its major symptoms.

Before you tackle what to do when you feel depressed, you need to explore the difference between sadness and depression. The goal isn’t to self-diagnose, but toself-reflectand consider whether speaking to amental health professionalis the right call.

Here are some differences between sadness and depression, according toMedical News Today:

If you’re sad and grappling with how to make yourself feel better, having a roadmap can help you follow a path to a better mood. Here are some strategies to guide you:

Guilt sometimes accompanies sadness, especially if you know other people are worried about you. But feeling sad isn’t a sign of personal failure. It’s a universal human experience and a normal response to certain life events.

Instead of blaming yourself or feeling guilty for youremotional distress, view the purpose of sadness as a natural part of life's journey. Tryjournalingor starting a conversation with friends to reassure yourself that the feeling is normal. This acceptance can open the door to better understanding andemotional regulationwithout the burden of judgment orself-pity.

Being kind to yourself isn’t an indulgence. It's essential to maintaininghealth and well-being, even when you’re sad. Spend time with yourself as you would with a friend if they were upset. This could involve engaging in activities that make you happy orpracticing self-care.

Remember, whether it's soaking in a hot bath, immersing yourself in agood book, or taking a mindful walk in nature, these activities are never a waste of time. They're important tools totake care of your mental healthand remind yourself that life is more than sadness.

One powerful form of self-help is expressing your feelings through writing oranxiety journaling. Penning your emotions in a private place offers a safe space to acknowledge and explore your feelings. This process brings clarity and helps you identify the sources of your sadness if you’re unsure. Think of it as a self-guided exploration, offering insights into your emotional landscape.

Rather than pushing your sad feelings aside or trying to cover them up, allow yourself to feel them. Experiencing a range of emotions is an integral part of being human — and that includes sadness.

It’s easier said than done, but embrace these feelings and learnhow to improve your emotionsinstead of resisting them. Speak with a friend,coach, or therapist, and be honest about what’s going on. That truth is the first step to healing.

Simplebreathing exercisesor meditation practices are excellent ways tocalm yourself down, and they can work wonders for alltypes of stressand anxiety. When you focus on your breath, you ground yourself in the present moment, creating a sense of stability that can alleviate feelings of sadness.

Sometimes people cry at work, around friends or family, or alone. And studies show it’s actually good for you because it releaseshappy hormones. If you feel the urge to cry, allow yourself that release. It's a form of emotional expression that offers relief and healing.

Pursue activities that bring you joy and lift your spirits, even if you don’t feel like doing them in the moment. Whether dancing in your living room, playing with your pet, or simply enjoying a cup of your favorite tea,find happinessin small moments.

Painting, writing, or gardening are great ways toexpress your emotionsand lift your spirits. They can help you navigate and eventually work through your feelings, or simply offer a distraction if that’s what you need.Think outside the boxand find something thatignites your passion.

Music can help you concentrateand significantly influence your mood. A song with a positive message or an uplifting beat can remind you of the things you love, offering an easy and enjoyable way to combat feelings of sadness. Turn on one of your favorite songs and let the music flow.

According to a study by JAMA Psychiatry,just 15 minutes of running per day reduces your chances of depression. Butexercise benefitsdon’t just stem from running or jogging. Any movement adds up to keep negative feelings at bay, so moving your body more in any way throughout the day positively impacts your mood.

University of Pennsylvania researchers found thatindividuals limited to 4.5 hours of sleep a night for one week reported more anger, sadness, and mental exhaustion. Inadequate sleep causes irritability and stress, so prioritizing is essential to stabilizing your mood. Take a look at yoursleep hygienehabits and try to find ways to get more rest.

Sharing your feelings with a trusted individual can provide tremendous relief. They might not know what to say to someone who is sad, but that isn’t the point. This is about vocalizing your emotions and being vulnerable, allowing someone else to offer support, understanding, and a fresh perspective if they have it.

Remember, if your sadness feels overwhelming or persists, don't hesitate to contact amental health organization. It's not a sign of weakness but an essential step toward well-being.

If you’re managing feelings of sadness, it's important to know what signs might indicate a deeper mental health issue. Here are a few to look out for:

Persistent sadness: It's normal to have periods of feeling down. But if you're constantly asking yourself, “Why am I sad for no reason?” or if the sadness doesn’t seem to lift, it could signal a more severe condition like clinical depression.

This could be an enduring low mood that interferes with daily activities, impacts your relationships, or leads to physical symptoms of depression like a change in appetite or sleep patterns.

These signs aren't something to feel guilty or embarrassed about. They're indicators that it's time toask for help, which is a courageous step. Mental health conditions, including depression, aren't character flaws. They're real health issues that you can manage with the right treatment.

Learning how to deal with sadness isn't easy, but you're not alone.

If you’re wondering what to do when you’re sad, focus on the things that bring you joy, seek help when you need it, and remember that it's okay to feel sad. You have the power to navigate these feelings, and with these strategies, you'll be well on your way to reclaiming your sunshine.

Feeling sad all the time for no specific reason doesn’t always mean you have depression, but itdoessuggest you could be experiencing something more complex than sadness alone.

Sadness is a temporary state that often has a clear cause, like a big disappointment, theloss of someone close to you, or bad news from someone you love.

This type of sadness can fluctuate throughout the day. In certain moments, the emotional burden might feel particularly heavy. You mightcry often, feel numb or drained, and struggle to concentrate.

At other times — when you get lost in something you enjoy or when a loved one distracts you — your sorrow may seem light enough that you can barely feel its weight. While it might linger in some form for days or weeks, it generally begins to ease naturally.

Persistent sadness is something else entirely. It can wrap around you like a heavy blanket, muffling the sensations and joy of everyday life. This sadness can leave you feeling low, empty, and defeated. You don’t know what caused your unhappiness, so you have no idea how to start feeling better.

Feeling sad isn’t at all unusual. After all, sorrow is a normal human response to disappointment and loss. Sadness that doesn’t have a clear reason behind it and doesn’t seem to improve, however, may suggest something else is going on.

While not everyone withdepressionwill feel sad, unexplainable sadness you can’t seem to shakeisone of the primary signs of depression.

If your sadnessdoes relate to depression, you’ll likely feel sad nearly all of the time — almost every day, for most of each day, for a period of 2 weeks or longer. Sadness, in other words, seems to become a constant companion.

With depression, you’ll experienceother symptoms, too. If several of the signs below accompany your sad or tearful mood, there’s a good chance you’re dealing with depression:

Chronic sadness, especially when related to depression, might also prompt regularthoughts of death or suicide. Even if you don’t have a plan to act on these thoughts, it’s always best to talk to someone you trust and get support right away (more on how to do this later).

You might begin to notice your feelings of sadness, along with any other symptoms you experience, follow a specific pattern. Depression can take different forms, and various underlying factors can have an impact on the way your symptoms show up.

A few things to look for:

People living withbipolar disorderoften experience episodes of depression as part of a cycle that also includes episodes ofmania or hypomania.

You might notice you suddenly feel intensely happy, even euphoric. This abrupt change in mood might also involve:

This episode might last a week, or longer.

Somewhere around40 percentof people with bipolar disorder have what’s known as mixed features. You could experience sadness and other symptoms of depression at the same time as mania.

This combination of symptoms can make it harder to understand what you’re experiencing, which could add to your distress.

Maybe your sadness seems to arrive or intensify around the same time of year the days begin to shorten. Once the longer, sunnier days of spring and summer arrive, you feel better, year after year.

It’s pretty common to feel a little low in autumn and winter. The nights get long and cold, and there are plenty of days when you may not even see the sun.

If this seasonal sadness persists and becomes serious enough to affect daily life, you could haveseasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression that occurs along with seasonal changes.

Along with other common depression symptoms, you might also notice:

Reproductive hormones can also play a part in depression symptoms, so tracking what time of the month symptoms show up can offer some important clues.

Symptoms of depression often become serious enough to get in the way of everyday functioning, but that isn’t always the case.

With most forms of depression, periods of sadness might last a few weeks or longer, depending on the type of depression you have, and then lift temporarily. You might not feel sad or notice any other symptoms for some time.

Withpersistent depressive disorder (PDD), on the other hand, mood symptoms won’t show up in clear episodes. Instead, they often last for years. With PDD, you may no longer recall a time when you didn’t feel somewhat sad or depressed. You might:

Unlike symptoms of major depression, symptoms of PDD may not prevent you from living your daily life. Still, as you work, go to school, and take care of your regular responsibilities. you’ll likely notice an ever-present sad or low mood.

When sadness tints every aspect of your day-to-day an unrelenting gray, you might have trouble finding relief. Feeling down can also make it more difficult to brainstorm potentially helpful changes, which is why professional support can make a big difference (more on this in a moment).

In the meantime, these strategies may offer a bit of relief.

Many of the symptoms associated with sadness or depression can prompt you to pull back from others rather than seekemotional support.

When feeling irritable, you might get frustrated with loved ones easily. You might experience guilt over negative feelings toward others, your need to cancel plans, or your disinterest in your usual activities. It’s also fairly common to find yourself doubting whether loved ones actually care about you and want to spend time with you.

Isolating yourself will generally only worsen sadness, though, so sharing your feelings with someone you trust can help a lot. Even opening up to just one close friend or family member can help you feel less alone.

Talking won’t necessarily make your symptoms go away, but it can help the burden seem lighter. You’ll also have someone you can turn to if you need additional support.

People commonly use humor as a method of coping with depression and other mental health conditions.

Even when you don’t feel much like laughing or cracking jokes, funny books, YouTube videos, or your favorite comedy program can often take the edge off your sadness and help raise your spirits.

Not a fan of comedy? Taking a beloved book off the shelf or curling up with a nostalgic movie can sometimes offer similar benefits.

Music offers a number ofmental health benefits, including temporary relief from sadness and other symptoms of depression. It can help energize you, so you could also see some improvements in any fatigue you’re experiencing.

Listening to music can encourage your brain to produce hormones likedopamineandserotonin. These “happy hormones” have been linked to improvements in mood and reducedanxietyandstress.

Just try to avoid music that matches your mood. Wallowing can seem like a good way to get those feelings out, but mournful tunes might end upworsening sadness or depression. Aim for upbeat music with a faster tempo.

Your favorite hobbies may seem less enjoyable when you feel sad or down, but giving them a try anyway can sometimes offer mood-boosting benefits.

If you’re struggling to muster up any energy, try low-key activities instead of ones that you feel exhausted just thinking about.

A few possibilities:

“Have you tried going outside?” can sound like something a well-meaning loved one with no real knowledge of mood disorders might say. Yet while sunlight won’t completely cure feelings of sadness or depression, regular sun exposurecanmake a differencefor bothphysical and mental well-being.

Experts believe sunlight prompts your brain toproduce serotonin. When you have lower levels of this hormone in your system, you’re more likely to feel depressed, especially as fall and winter roll around. Spending more time in the sun, then, can increase serotonin and potentially relieve sadness.

Exercise can also offer somemood-boosting benefits, so if you feel up to it, combine your sun exposure with a walk around your neighborhood or in your favorite park.

Can’t get outside easily? Little sun to speak of? Light therapy with aSAD lampcan help you get some artificial sun that still offers very real benefits.

Coping strategies won’t always help relieve sadness. If nothing seems to help you find relief, it may be time to talk to a therapist or other healthcare professional.

Professional support is always recommended when symptoms:

It’s important toget help right awayif you have thoughts of death, dying, or suicide. Therapy offers a safe space to address and manage these thoughts over the long term, but in-the-moment support may be more helpful if you’re experiencing distressing thoughts during a mental health crisis.

You can find a therapist in your area with a quick Google search, using a therapist directory, or by asking a primary care provider for a referral.

When talking with a healthcare professional, be sure to tell them about any patterns you’ve noticed with your symptoms, including seasonal mood changes or cycles between extreme sadness and extreme elation.

Also, consider keeping track of changing moods andemotionsin ajournal. This helps express and sort through feelings at the moment, but it also creates a log of symptoms you can share with your care team.

Feeling sad all the time for no specific reason doesn’t always mean you have depression, but itdoessuggest you could be experiencing something more complex than sadness alone.

When sadness lingers and becomes more of a fixed state of being, talking to a therapist can have a lot of benefits. In the meantime, be gentle with yourself and try to remember that this feeling won’t last forever.

Hi, I'm Dr. Craig Sawchuk, a clinical psychologist at Mayo Clinic. And I'm here to talk with you about depression. Whether you're looking for answers for yourself, a friend, or loved one, understanding the basics of depression can help you take the next step.

Depression is a mood disorder that causes feelings of sadness that won't go away. Unfortunately, there's a lot of stigma around depression. Depression isn't a weakness or a character flaw. It's not about being in a bad mood, and people who experience depression can't just snap out of it. Depression is a common, serious, and treatable condition. If you're experiencing depression, you're not alone. It honestly affects people of all ages and races and biological sexes, income levels and educational backgrounds. Approximately one in six people will experience a major depressive episode at some point in their lifetime, while up to 16 million adults each year suffer from clinical depression. There are many types of symptoms that make up depression. Emotionally, you may feel sad or down or irritable or even apathetic. Physically, the body really slows down. You feel tired. Your sleep is often disrupted. It's really hard to get yourself motivated. Your thinking also changes. It can just be hard to concentrate. Your thoughts tend to be much more negative. You can be really hard on yourself, feel hopeless and helpless about things. And even in some cases, have thoughts of not wanting to live. Behaviorally, you just want to pull back and withdraw from others, activities, and day-to-day responsibilities. These symptoms all work together to keep you trapped in a cycle of depression. Symptoms of depression are different for everyone. Some symptoms may be a sign of another disorder or medical condition. That's why it's important to get an accurate diagnosis.

While there's no single cause of depression, most experts believe there's a combination of biological, social, and psychological factors that contribute to depression risk. Biologically, we think about genetics or a family history of depression, health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease or thyroid disorders, and even hormonal changes that happen over the lifespan, such as pregnancy and menopause. Changes in brain chemistry, especially disruptions in neurotransmitters like serotonin, that play an important role in regulating many bodily functions, including mood, sleep, and appetite, are thought to play a particularly important role in depression. Socially stressful and traumatic life events, limited access to resources such as food, housing, and health care, and a lack of social support all contribute to depression risk. Psychologically, we think of how negative thoughts and problematic coping behaviors, such as avoidance and substance use, increase our vulnerability to depression.

The good news is that treatment helps. Effective treatments for depression exist and you do have options to see what works best for you. Lifestyle changes that improve sleep habits, exercise, and address underlying health conditions can be an important first step. Medications such as antidepressants can be helpful in alleviating depressive symptoms. Therapy, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, teaches skills to better manage negative thoughts and improve coping behaviors to help break you out of cycles of depression. Whatever the cause, remember that depression is not your fault and it can be treated.

To help diagnose depression, your health care provider may use a physical exam, lab tests, or a mental health evaluation. These results will help identify various treatment options that best fit your situation.

Help is available. You don't have to deal with depression by yourself. Take the next step and reach out. If you're hesitant to talk to a health care provider, talk to a friend or loved one about how to get help. Living with depression isn't easy and you're not alone in your struggles. Always remember that effective treatments and supports are available to help you start feeling better. Want to learn more about depression? Visit mayoclinic.org. Do take care.

Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living.

More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness and you can't simply "snap out" of it. Depression may require long-term treatment. But don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychotherapy or both.

Depression care at Mayo Clinic

Although depression may occur only once during your life, people typically have multiple episodes. During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include:

For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others. Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why.

Common signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers are similar to those of adults, but there can be some differences.

Depression is not a normal part of growing older, and it should never be taken lightly. Unfortunately, depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated in older adults, and they may feel reluctant to seek help. Symptoms of depression may be different or less obvious in older adults, such as:

If you feel depressed, make an appointment to see your doctor or mental health professional as soon as you can. If you're reluctant to seek treatment, talk to a friend or loved one, any health care professional, a faith leader, or someone else you trust.

If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 in the U.S. or your local emergency number immediately.

Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts:

If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.

It's not known exactly what causes depression. As with many mental disorders, a variety of factors may be involved, such as:

Depression often begins in the teens, 20s or 30s, but it can happen at any age. More women than men are diagnosed with depression, but this may be due in part because women are more likely to seek treatment.

Factors that seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering depression include:

Depression is a serious disorder that can take a terrible toll on you and your family. Depression often gets worse if it isn't treated, resulting in emotional, behavioral and health problems that affect every area of your life.

Examples of complications associated with depression include:

There's no sure way to prevent depression. However, these strategies may help.

(02:01) gonna create a little bit of turmoil a little bit of inner inflammation number three your feelings don't last for longer than a couple of weeks they go away in an appropriate amount time number four you're feeling sad and you recognize that but you don't feel like hopelessness and despair about the future you don't go that far forward you stay right in the present where you are and just experience your sadness but you're not suddenly feeling like there is no hope for anything beyond number
(02:27) five you're able to stay productive in your day-to-day life you're you're able to rise to life's demands whether it be as a parent as an employee as a partner as a friend as an athlete you're still showing up with relative ease number six your negative thoughts are realistic negative thoughts like you're down because something tangible is going on that you can identify you're not just feeling overwhelmed despairing and hopeless for absolutely no apparent reason for a longer period of time
(02:56) hashtag life on life's terms now let's talk about some of the characteristics of what may be actual depression number one naturally we're gonna start with a loss of self-esteem as you start talking thinking and behaving very negatively towards yourself number two the way you're behaving the way you're feeling thinking are objectively out of proportion with the reality or actuality of your event a huge dark emotion for relatively small triggers or none at all actually number three these feelings of apathy these
(03:27) feelings of sadness this hopelessness this down dark cloud over you last longer than a couple weeks it's just lingering it stays there and despite your best efforts or none at all I suppose it's not going away number four you feel like things are not going to get better you start to attach your current mood with your future mood catastrophic thinking you you start to not see past the the hopelessness and the depressed feeling and it starts to create a reality for your long-term this was a huge huge trigger and warning sign

(04:32) essentially a withdrawal from your normal day-to-day life experience that once came very natural to you and number six your negative thoughts start to get exaggerated and distorted even though to you they seem perfectly reasonable this one is easier to figure out if you have someone who can sit down with you and who has your best interest in mind can tell you lucky you're not behaving like your normal self you're not thinking clearly a therapist is a really good outside third party who can look at you
(05:02) with no emotional attachments and kind of help you understand where your thinking has gone wayward and why your thinking is gone wayward so these are a few of the fundamental differences between sadness and actual depression if you have any confusion as to whether or not you're actually depressed still I strongly recommend you fill out some online questionnaires download some things that you can actually look at and checkboxes to or make an appointment to talk to someone it is nothing but a sign of strength to take care of yourself

7 Signs It is Not Depression, But Sadness - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjyx6cMdu7M

Transcript:
(00:00) - [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers. When exactly does sadness become depression? Because these two words are often used interchangeably, some people get confused about their distinction. Saying you're depressed is different from saying you have depression, because the latter is referring to a mental illness, not an emotion.
(00:19) When you're feeling down or have been feeling down for a long time, you might wonder which one you're experiencing. Depression is usually more severe in terms of its duration and the extent of how it affects your life, whereas sadness is normal and may take less time to recover from. With that said, there are some differences between normal sadness and clinical depression, and we're going to talk about seven of them now.
(00:42) Number one, you're still able to enjoy the simple things. Do you still find yourself laughing while watching your favorite show? If you still have the energy to enjoy your hobbies, you're most likely going through normal's sadness, not clinical depression. People diagnosed with depression often find themselves with an overwhelming feeling of liturgy, and may have no interest in doing things that once brought them happiness.
(01:06) This numbness can extend for long periods, which is different from normal sadness. Number two, you have enough energy to complete your daily tasks. Are you still eating all of your meals? Do you have any difficulty sleeping? Depression often comes with an inability to complete regular activities because you lack the energy and don't see the purpose while you're unhappy.
(01:29) Even simple things like going to the bathroom can seem tiring to you. Depressed people often stay in their beds, losing track of time with a feeling of numbness. A sad person may be more silent and inactive than usual, but once the needs arise, they eat, use the bathroom and take care of themselves. Number three, you still talk to your friends and loved ones.
(01:50) Do you open up to your friends or rant or cry about what's been going on? People with depression may be unable to perform these acts, as depression can stem from nothing at all. A person may live a completely normal life and suddenly find themselves experiencing sudden feelings of numbness and hopelessness.
(02:09) Because of that, some people choose not to open up at all, which may prevent them from reaching out for help because they may feel that they're not worth the effort. This is different from normal sadness because you still welcome your relationships. When you're sad, you may wanna take a break and isolate yourself for a little while, but eventually, you usually get back to socializing.
(02:31) Number four, your self-esteem is not permanently affected. It's normal for sad people to have negative feelings about themselves and the things that are troubling them. Emotions such as remorse, regret and hopelessness are common when you've experienced an unfortunate event, but they tend to fade over time, especially when you know the root of the problem and are working on it.
(02:51) This differs from depressed people who are caught in a continuous loop of negativity which can extend to thoughts and acts of self harm or even suicide. Being able to recover from a bad experience is a good indicator of your mental health. If you know someone who harbors continuous negative thoughts, you can help them by letting them know that you're available to help.
(03:12) They may not wanna talk just us yet, but your presence is just as important. Number five, you're experiencing burnout. Do you find that being with your friends no longer makes you happy as it used to? Even though nothing's changed or maybe you find it difficult to maintain the routine you've created for yourself through weeks, months, or years.
(03:33) Everybody needs a timeout, otherwise they're at risk of burnout, which is characterized by feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion caused by prolonged stress and can be mistaken for depression. With burnout, you may find yourself unable to complete your tasks due to increased mental distance from them, or no energy because you're unable to cope with the stress you've been enduring for a long time.
(03:55) If you can relate, it might be a good idea to practice a good work life balance. Try to give time to every aspect of your life to avoid burnout. You can schedule activities such as taking an overnight trip with your friends, going on a blind date, or even going to that dancing class you've been eyeing. Keep active and explore many things to avoid stagnation.
(04:16) And if that doesn't work after some time, a visit to a therapist or doctor might help. Number six, you feel better after letting it out. Do you feel lighter after a good cry? Feeling better after letting your emotions out is a good indicator that you're sad, not depressed, because clinically depressed people often don't see the point in opening up about what they're experiencing, and tend to see themselves as worthless and undeserving of attention.
(04:41) Because of this, their relationships, friendships and careers could be at risk. According to Chocolate, talking about your feelings is important because it helps you process your emotions, develop emotional awareness, and clear your mind. So it's better to let your emotions out than to keep them in. That's why it's really helpful to be surrounded by trustworthy and understanding friends.
(05:02) And number seven, time heals you. After a few weeks or even months, do you still find yourself experiencing the same situation or are you slowly forgetting about it? Being able to bounce back is an indicator that what you were experiencing is normal sadness, not depression. Depression is much more severe in terms of the extent of the symptoms and of how these symptoms impair the person's life.
(05:27) And doctors will look for symptoms that last at least two weeks as possible signs of depression. It can last for months or years, and is more difficult to recover from than normal sadness. So whenever you're sad, take your time to acknowledge your sadness, try to find healthy coping mechanisms, and surround yourself with loving and supportive friends and family.
(05:48) Can you relate to any of these points? Please share your replies in the comments below. As always, the references and studies used are in the description. Until next time friends, take care and thanks for watching.
















What are some tips for managing depression?


How To Cope With Depression - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Su5VtKeXU8

Transcript:
(00:05) Almost half of us will suffer from depression at some point in our lives, but the condition remains badly misunderstood and therefore often poorly treated. At the heart of our collective difficulty with depression is a confusion about what it actually is - and in particular, how it can be distinguished from a state all of us know very well and with which it is has a distracting number of similarities, namely sadness. It’s because we unwittingly tend to apply to cases of depression a number of assumptions drawn from, and better suited to, an understanding of sadness that we end up suffering far more than we should. There are, on the surface, some notable similarities between those who are sad and those who are depressed. Both groups cry; both withdraw from the world; both complain of listlessness and a sense of alienation from their normal lives. But there is one categorical difference between depression and sadness. The sad person knows what they are sad about; the depressed person doesn’t. Sad people can, without difficulty, tell us what is troubling them. I am sad that my grandmother has died. Or that I lost my job. Or that my friends are being unkind to me. And - though it might sound strange - this is precisely what the depressed person is not capable of doing. They may be tearful and at a very low ebb, but they can’t conclusively put a finger on what has drained life of meaning for them: they simply say it has no meaning per se. They aren’t depressed about x or y as one might be sad about x or y. They are, first and foremost simply depressed. The inability of the depressed person to account concretely for their mood can lay them open to unwarranted charges of faking, malingering or exaggerating. Friends who begin in a well-meaning search for a soluble problem can end up frustrated by the lack of progress. When pushed, the depressed person may latch on to rather odd or minor-sounding issues to account for their state: they might complain that there is no point going to work because the earth is due to be absorbed by the sun in 7.5 billion years. Or they might insist that life lacks all meaning because they’ve just dropped a glass on the floor and everything is now completely hopeless. At this stage, one can hear it said that if depression doesn’t have any any sensible psychological causes, the problem must be bound up with some kind of imbalance in brain chemistry, which it would be kinder and more effective to treat with pills - an idea of great appeal to the pharmaceutical industry first and foremost, but also to worried families and schools and employers who crave rapid and cost-effective solutions. But there is another approach to depression which, though slower and more arduous, may be a great deal more effective in the long-term. This stems from insights drawn from psychotherapy, the discipline that has - arguably - been able to understand depression better than any other. The basic premise of psychotherapy is that the depressed person isn’t depressed - as they suggest - for no reason. There is a reason. They are very distressed about something but that something is proving extremely difficult to take on board, and has therefore been pushed into the outer zones of consciousness - from where it wreaks havoc on the whole person, prompting boundless feelings of nihilism. For depressives, realising what they are concretely upset about would be too devastating, so they unconsciously choose to remain dead to everything, as opposed to very distraught about something. Depression is sadness that has forgotten its true causes - forgotten because remembering may generate overwhelming, untenable feelings of pain and loss. What might these true causes be? Perhaps that we have married the very wrong person. Or that our sexuality isn’t what we once believed. Or that we are furious with a parent for their lack of care in childhood. In order to preserve a fragile peace of mind, one then ‘chooses’ - though that may sound more willed than it is in reality - to be depressed rather than to have a realisation. We pick unceasing numbness as protection against dreadful insight. To make things yet more difficult, the depressed person doesn’t typically consciously feel that they are in fact lacking insight. They are not aware of a gap in their self-understanding. Furthermore, they are nowadays often taught to assume that they are ‘just depressed’, as one might be physically ill - a verdict that can be of appeal as much to the pharmaceutical industry as to certain people close to the patient with an interest in insights remaining buried. There’s another key difference to note between sadness and depression. Sad people are grief-stricken about something out in the world but they aren’t necessarily sad about themselves, their self-esteem is unaffected by their grief, whereas depressed people will characteristically feel wretched about themselves and be full of self-recrimination, guilt, shame and self-loathing paranoia that may, at tragic extremes, culminate in suicidal thoughts. For psychotherapy, the origins of these violent moods of self-hatred lie in anger due for, but unable to be directed towards, someone else in the world - that has then turned against the sufferer. Wrathful feelings that should have gone outwards, towards a partner who is relentlessly defensive and denies one sex or a parent who humiliated one in childhood, are instead driven back onto the sufferer and starts to attack them. The feeling: ‘X has horribly let me down’ turns into a very unpleasant but in some ways more bearable ‘I’m an unworthy and unbearable wretch.’ One becomes self-hating as a defence against the risks of hating someone else. Also worth noting in all this is that, in many cases, depression is associated with an apparently opposite mood, a kind euphoric state termed mania, hence the term ‘manic-depressive’. The mania in question looks, from a distance, a bit like happiness, just like depression can look like sadness. But in one area in particular, the relationship between mania and happiness is identical to that between depression and sadness. The common element is a disavowed self-knowledge. In mania, one is euphoric, but cannot go into one’s own deep mind and discover its bitter truths. Which explains one of the leading characteristics of manic people: their habit of being in flight from themselves, talking too fast about nothing, over-exercising, working continuously or spending too much - all as an escape from a submerged grief, rage and loss. It is from this kind of diagnosis that a suggested cure emerges. What people in depression need above all is a chance to arrive at insight. For this, they will tend to need a hugely supportive and patient listener. They may also - used appropriately - benefit from temporary use of medication to lift their mood just enough so that they can endure a conversation. But the assumption isn’t that brain chemistry is where the problem either begins or ends; the despair is caused by an undigested, unknown and unresolved trauma. Far from needing to be taken through reasons to trust that life is beautiful, depressives must be allowed to feel and to remember specific damage - and to be granted a fundamental sense of the legitimacy of their emotions. They need to be allowed to be angry, and for the anger to settle on the right, awkward targets. The goal in treating depression is to move a sufferer from feeling limitlessly despairing to mourning the loss of something in particular: the last twenty years, a marriage, a hope one would be loved by one’s father, a career... However agonising the insight and mourning might be, these must always be preferable to allowing loss to contaminate the totality of one’s perspective. There are plenty of dreadful things in every life - which is why it is wholly normal to feel sad on a regular basis. But there are also always a sufficient number of things that remain beautiful and hopeful, so long as one has been allowed to understand and known one’s pain and anger - and adequately mourn one’s losses.

(00:34) lamb Dr Judy ho Dr Dominic sportelli Dr shafali the list goes on and on Dr thuslam Dr suvarma uh Dr Judith Joseph I love all of our doctors and I've learned so much from all of them there are tried and true measures for treating depression like cognitive behavioral therapy or antidepressants but in this video I'm going to share what I do to handle or man manage my depression and of course this is coming from somebody who is not a doctor somebody who just has lived experience with depression I was diagnosed with depression when I was
(01:12) nine years old yes I am medicated I take 40 military 40 milligrams of Prozac and either one or two milligrams of Abilify I should know that and uh I was put on Prozac when I was nine years old after I was diagnosed with depression so this is something that I have lived with my entire life and it is something that now I feel very confident in managing with the help of therapy and antidepressants and some of the tips that I'll get into right now number one first way I handle this is radically accept that I am depressed
(01:54) so often I think we are encouraged both directly and indirectly to shake off depression oh yeah you're not depressed or you know everyone feels that way a little bit every now and then blah blah blah and we don't actually just acknowledge that yeah we are depressed you are depressed I am depressed I radically accept that in my life my relationship with this thing I call depression is going to ebb and flow and rear its ugly head throughout the year and I radically accept that when I radically accept something though
(02:31) it doesn't mean I love it it doesn't mean that I'm even happy about it but there is a peace and contentment that comes with just acknowledging the truth and understanding that I can only do so much and the rest I must accept much easier for me to say this than it is to probably do this however I think if we personally if people would start to radically accept some of the smaller things in their life then it becomes easier to radically accept some of the bigger things in their life like depression again I wanna I wanna belabor
(03:12) this point in saying that it I'm not trying to say that radical acceptance means you're okay with all of this or your depression isn't real or depression doesn't hurt it's all of those things in fact that's what I'm advocating for is that we acknowledge that in its entirety and it's in its fullness that this depression is real it does hurt and when we can sit there when I know when I can sit there and accept that I go okay this is real this is true I accept this now I can move forward with a little more
(03:46) clarity a little more peace a little more content meant radical acceptance has been brought up by virtually every doctor I've talked to and the applications are many I invite you to learn more about that concept and see how you can imply apply it in your life of course I hope you do it through Med Circle at medcircle.
(04:05) com but you know you can do it anywhere you wish number two is a concept called behavioral activation behavioral activation is approach to mental health that focuses on using behaviors to quote activate Pleasant emotions the idea is that by I always have that one friend who loves to call me when I'm in the middle of a live stream can you believe that the nerve there we go I'm on do not disturb now uh the idea is that by putting actions first a person does not need to wait to feel motivated but they can still gain the benefits that the action has on
(04:42) their well-being I'm reading a quote from medical news today behavioral activation and how it works I was taught this concept I believe First by triple board certified forensic and neuropsychologist Dr Judy ho and it's very uh simple to understand which works really great for me but one way that I can behaviorally activate is uh to go on a walk now before you roll your eyes and go oh my gosh if one more person tells me to go on a walk when I'm depressed I get it but when you are depressed when I'm
(05:17) depressed I don't want to go on a walk even though I know it's good for me I don't want to get out of bed even though I know it would probably be good for my overall health but you do it anyway because you can't wait for the motivation to do it that's not there the depression zaps my motivation depression comes in and goes you are you have no more motivation that is gone okay so if you rely on motivation to do the things that are good for you you will be waiting forever to do those things
(05:51) so instead I take a cue from Nike and I just do it you just force it even if you think gosh this is not going to be fun it's like have you ever heard of a cold plunge cold plunge it's a bathtub filled with freezing cold water you have to stay in there for I don't know a few minutes it's terrible I don't think anyone's like oh I love getting into a cold lunch maybe somebody is but nobody I know but it's still good for you afterwards you feel better kind of modeling behavioral activation
(06:26) there don't want to do it no it's good for you gonna do it anyway afterwards you feel better man a powerful thing where take the the emotion out of it take the motivation out of it it's already gone but take all of that away and just do the behavioral activation do the activity and experience the benefit the worst thing that would happen is you go on a walk and you come home and you're still depressed and you don't like your walk okay but you did something you tried you tried find that other thing I don't think behavioral
(07:00) activation has to be in the form of just a physical exercise either I think it's doing anything that you know we know the things that bring us value sitting for six hours and watching Netflix do it okay I I've done it do it can't wait to do it again but to use that as the behavioral activation no no no we want to go I I think it's important to do things that we know have a Lego little bigger benefit than that not that there's anything that there is benefits from binging six hours of Netflix I
(07:29) think but going out on a walk going out by the pool going and uh playing with your dog picking up the phone and calling a friend or a family member doing all those things even I want to do it I don't want to talk to that person I want to play with my dog I don't want to go sit by the pool just do it anyway behavioral activation do it anyway it works it works it works all right so number one radical radical acceptance number two Implement behavioral activations number three focus on your distractions focus on your distractions this almost
(08:05) sounds like an improbability to focus on a distraction but what I mean by that is prioritize healthy distractions healthy coping skills I think just we are we are pros at distracting ourselves unintentionally subconsciously we're really good at burying ourselves in a tub of ice cream so we don't have to think about our depression we're really good at getting a blanket and binging six hours of Netflix so we can just Escape our problems we're really good at distracting with no with with less intention behind
(08:47) it it's kind of just like the numbness the autopilot of it all don't do the autopilot make a distraction so intentional that it becomes a healthy way to manage depression that could look like I'm going to paint I'm going to have this mindful activity of painting it is so hard to learn how to paint and think about your depression or think about how things aren't going well or think about even what you have to do today because the the distraction of painting requires your entire presence your entire Focus
(09:29) the ultimate mindfulness activity I used to call this or I still do call it but sometimes I'll refer to it as forced mindfulness because we always hear we need to be mindful but it's hard to be mindful if you're just sitting by yourself that's when it's hardest I think that's like level 10 of mindfulness when you're just like I'm mindful in the moment and nothing that's great good good job you made it there but for the rest of us some of us need a little help to be mindful that is where I think a forced
(09:57) mindfulness activity like painting like knitting like learning a dance when you have to focus on this thing by definition it is it's almost impossible to not focus on this other thing you can't be you can't be ruminating on your I can't ruminate on my negative thoughts if I'm trying to learn choreography because it requires all my attention these types of intentional distractions can really give you a break from the rumination of a mental illness like depression so I leverage these distractions by
(10:38) doing a few one big distraction for me mindful Force mindfulness activity I uh train my dog she's well trained I don't need to train her she knows all the things she needs to know but I can't teach her something new and be caught up in my depression it's very hard actually as I'm saying this out loud this is like a behavioral activation in some ways even if you're not motivated to go train your dog once you get into the the training session you're so focused it's all of a sudden you do it for 15 minutes
(11:11) and then you end and you go man I just had a 15 minute break of not feeling depressed because I was so focused on the dog training that is a great that's a win that is such a win these healthy intentional distractions are such a win okay so the recap number one radical acceptance I radically accept I'm depressed that doesn't mean I love it I'm happy about it that doesn't mean I'm uh saying well I give up because I'm I accept this and quite the contrary I accept it so I can pursue Solutions I accept this for exactly what
(11:48) it is in its entirety I accept what I can control I accept what I can't control and I move forward with that acceptance powerful number two behavioral activation you don't have to wait to be motivated to do the thing that you know is good for you if you're waiting to get motivated to go work out you know if you're like me you'll just never go work out but if you just go work out and then you're in the workout and you're feeling the endorphins and you finish the workout and you feel good
(12:23) that you did it all of a sudden you got all of those benefits of doing this activity that you weren't motivated to do in the first place but you did it anyway and you got all those benefits behavioral activation simple in concept profound in its implications on your life Dr Judy taught me that number three intentional distractions we are going to distract ourselves from the problems in our life that is what our our brain wants to protect us and it's going to distract us it's going to get distracted but let's try to have
(12:58) some moments of intentional distraction healthy distraction those forced mindfulness sessions like learning choreography go on YouTube and go simple choreography stand up learn that choreography do that for 15 minutes at 15 minutes you go I haven't thought once about how I'm depressed you still might be depressed afterwards but you had a 15 minute break okay I know I'm belaborating this point but I get so amped up about it so that final piece just distraction take those try them if you love them great and think how
(13:32) beneficial this video was if you go that was lame I hated all three of those I tried them and I don't like them okay maybe you tried the wrong thing you need to try another thing but maybe that's just not for you there is an endless list of ways to help yourself when you're struggling through feelings of depression those are just three that work for me I would love to read in the comments any that work for you it can be something small something profound something big something tiny something easy something
(14:01) difficult something you've been doing your whole life something you're just trying to do and it may or may not work I let let's create a resource in the comments section for people just go let me try that oh that's a good idea from this user let we can help each other right now I gave my three what is your one I gave three what is your one put it in the comments section on how you handle and manage whatever mental health struggle that you're going through I really appreciate people watching this

You can take steps to cope with and navigate depression. Small changes to your daily routine, diet, and lifestyle habits can all positively affect you.

Depression can drain your energy, leaving you feeling empty and fatigued. This can make it difficult to muster the strength or desire to get treatment. Small lifestyle changes may help you manage these feelings.

If a person feels sustained, intense feelings of sadness or loss of interest in activities, they may have clinical depression. People also refer to this condition asmajor depressive disorder.

But there are small steps you can take to help you gain more agency in your life and improve your sense of well-being.

Read on to learn how to incorporate these strategies in a way that makes sense for you.

Depression affectsmillions of people, including some in your life. You may not realize they face similar challenges, emotions, and obstacles.

Being open, accepting, and loving toward yourself and what you’re going through may help you navigate depression.

Every day with this disorder is different. It’s important to take your mental health seriously and accept that where you are right now isn’t where you’ll always be.

On days when you feel you can’t get out of bed, exercise may seem like the last thing you’d want to do. But exercise and physical activity can helpreduce symptomsof depression and improve energy levels.

Researchsuggests that, for some people, exercise can be as effective as medication at relieving depression symptoms. It may also helppreventfuturedepressive episodes.

Even when you feel you’re unable to or have little energy, see if you’d be willing to do the opposite of what your mood tells you to do. Instead, set a small goal for yourself, such as walking around the block.

Internal emotions and thoughts can change from day to day. Tracking experiences through journaling or keeping a mood diary can help you to remember this.

If you were unsuccessful at getting out of bed or accomplishing goals today, remember that you haven’t lost tomorrow’s opportunity to try again.

Give yourself the graceto accept that while some days will be difficult, others will also be less difficult. Try to look forward to tomorrow’s fresh start.

Depression can tinge recollections with difficult emotions. You may find yourself focusing on things that are unhelpful or perceived as difficult.

Try to stop this overgeneralization. Push yourself to recognize the good. If it helps,write downwhat was meaningful about the event or day. You can track what you achieved that day and which activities were enjoyable.

Seeing the weight you’re giving to one thing may help you direct your thoughts away from the whole and to the individual pieces that were helpful.

Theautomatic, unhelpful voicein your head may talk you out ofself-help. But if you learn to recognize this voice, you can learn to work through it.

If you believe an event won’t be fun or worth your time, say to yourself, “You might be right, but it’ll be better than just sitting here another night.” You may soon see that automatic thought isn’t always helpful.

Depression is one of the most common mental health conditions: Learn more.

Instead of compiling a long list of tasks, consider settingsmall goals. Setting and accomplishing these goals can provide a sense of control and accomplishment andhelp with motivation.

Attainable goals may include:

When you’ve done a small thing, set your eyes on another small thing, and then another. This way, you have a list of tangible achievements and not an untouched to-do list.

All goals are worthy of recognition, and all successes are worthy of celebration. When you achieve a goal, do your best to recognize it.

You may not feel like celebrating with a cake and confetti, but recognizing your own successes can be apowerful toolfor depression’s negative weight.

The memory of a job well done may be especially powerful againstunhelpful self-talkand overgeneralization.

Ifdepressive symptomsdisrupt your daily routine, a gentle schedule may help you feel in control. These plans don’t have to map out an entire day.

Focus on creating a loose but structured routine to help you keep your daily pace.

Depression can push you to give in to your fatigue. It may feel more powerful than preferred emotions.

Try to push back and do something you love — something that’s pleasurable or meaningful. It could be playing an instrument, painting, hiking, or biking.

Engaging in meaningful activities lifts your mood or energy, which can further motivate you to continue to engage in activities that help with navigating symptoms.

Researchshows music can improve your mood and symptoms of depression. It may also strengthen your reception of positive emotions.

Music can be especially beneficial when performed in group settings, such as a musical ensemble or band.

You can also reap some of the same rewards simply by listening.

Time in nature can have a powerful influence on a person’s mood.Researchsuggests that walks in nature may improve depressive symptoms in people with clinical depression.

Time in natural spaces may improve mood and cognition andlower the riskof mental health disorders. But there’s only limited research on the direct effect of nature on those with clinical depression.

Consider taking a walk at lunch among the trees or spending time in your local park. Or plan a weekend hike. These activities can help you reconnect with nature andsoak in some raysat the same time.

Depression can tempt you toisolate yourselfand withdraw from people you love and trust, but face-to-face time can help wash away those tendencies.

If you’re unable to spend time together in person, phone calls or video chats can also be helpful.

Try to remind yourself these people care about you. Resist the temptation to feel like you’re a burden. You need the interaction — and they likely do too.

Considerwriting or journalingabout what you’re experiencing. Then, when the feelings lift, write about that too.Researchsuggests that keeping a journal can be a beneficial add-on method for managing mental health conditions.

Writing downyour thoughts can help you express what you’re feeling more clearly. It can also help you keep track of your symptoms daily and identify their causes.

You can make a goal to write for a few minutes each day or week. Most importantly, what you want to write about is completely up to you.

When you do the same thing day after day, you use the same parts of your brain.

Doing new things can feel rewarding and mayimprove your overall well-beingand strengthen your social relationships.

To reap these benefits, consider trying a new sport, creative class, or cooking technique.

You can knock out a few birds with one stone — spending time with other people and doing something new — by volunteering and giving your time to someone or something else.

You may be used to receiving help from friends, but reaching out and providing help may actually improve your mental health more.

Bonus: People who volunteer experience physical benefits too. This includes alowered riskofhypertensionandimproved sleep.

When you do something you love, or even when you find a new activity you enjoy, you may be able to benefit your mental health more by taking time to be thankful for it.

Practicing gratitudecan have lasting positive effectson your overall mental health.

What’s more, writing down your gratitude — including in notes to others — can be particularly meaningful.

Stress and anxietycan prolong your depression symptoms. Findingrelaxation techniquescan help you lower stress and invite more joy and balance into your day.

Researchsuggests that mindfulness activities may help you improve your sense of well-being andfeel more connectedto what’s happening around you. These activities can include:

There’s no magic diet that will treat depression. But what you put into your bodycan have a real and significant effecton the way you feel.

Some people alsofeel betterand have more energy when they avoid sugar, preservatives, and processed foods.

If you have the means, consider meeting with a doctor or registered dietitian for guidance.

Eating a diet rich in lean meats, vegetables, and grains may be a great place to start. Try to limit stimulants such ascaffeine, coffee, and soda and depressants such asalcohol.

Substances such asdrugsoralcoholcan contribute to perpetuating feelings of sadness.

On the other hand, people who live with addiction may experiencesymptoms of depression.

You may want to consider limiting or avoiding the use of alcohol and other substances to help your depressive symptoms.

Sleep disturbancesare common with depression. You may not sleep well, or you may sleep too much. Both can make depression symptoms worse.

Aim for 8 hours of sleep per night. Try to get into ahealthy sleeping routine.

Going to bed andwaking up at the same timeevery day can help you with your daily schedule. Getting the proper amount of sleep may also help you feel more balanced and energized throughout your day.

Suppressing and compartmentalizing your feelings may seem like a strategic way to cope with the difficult symptoms of depression. But this technique isultimately unhealthyand ineffective.

If you’re having a down day, acknowledge it. Notice and name your emotions and try to bring your attention to engaging in activities that are helpful instead of focusing on the emotions.

Seeing the ebb and flow ofdepressive symptomscan be instructive for both self-healing and hope.

You may also find it helpful to speak with a professional about what you’re going through. A general practitioner may be able to refer you to a therapist or other specialist.

They can assess your symptoms and help develop a clinical treatment plan tailored to your needs. This may include various options, such asmedication and therapy.

Findingthe right treatmentfor you may take some time, so be open with a doctor or healthcare professional about what is and isn’t working. They’ll work with you to find the best option.

For some people, the fastest way to reduce symptoms of depression may be to use prescribed medication. The type and dosage of medication may vary from person to person. Other methods that may help include talking with a mental health professional. You may also help reduce symptoms by taking a walk in nature or doing a calming activity.

You may be able to relieve depression symptoms through therapy and some lifestyle changes, such as practicing mindfulness, getting regular exercise, and eating nutritious meals. In some cases, you may need medication to help.

Treatment for depression can involve therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, lifestyle changes such as practicing meditation and limiting alcohol and drugs, and in some cases, taking medication.

The best method for treating depression can vary depending on your needs and the severity of your symptoms. It can involve therapy, medication, and other practices that help you accept your own challenges and emotions.

Trying to beat depression? Small daily efforts can be more effective than sweeping changes.

Depression isn’t something you’re able to turn off like a switch. It doesn’t go away just because someone tells you to “toughen up” or because you had a moment of laughter during the day.

When you live withdepression, you know it often isn’t about the big moments in life. Sometimes, it’s all those quiet minutes of the day no one else sees.

When these moments feel like an eternity, there are ways you can loosen the hold depression has on daily life.

Beating depression and coping with depression aren’t the same. While there are many daily tips and tricks to cope with depression, “beating” depression implies a long-term resolution of symptoms.

Based on the volumes of research behind depression causes, daily goals may have the most beneficial impact if they:

Keeping these criteria in mind, you can start to develop some daily routines to help you beat depression.

The weight of an obligation is something that can make a task feel impossible when you live with depression. When youhaveto do something, the pressure can make you feel like you’re stuck in concrete.

Depression can stall you from doing things that might make a difference in the long term, like visiting supportive friends and family.

Reminders on your phone, computer, or tablet, can help refocus your attention on activities you might otherwise pass by. Writing these reminders in goal-form can also remind you it’s something that can help you feel a sense of accomplishment.

Researchsuggests a sense of accomplishment is one of five effective positive-psychology interventions for depression, along with:

An example of a goal-oriented reminder may be setting an alarm to call a supportive friend. Not only might you gain a sense of accomplishment after completing the task, you may also tick the boxes for pleasure, engagement, meaning, and positive relationships.

Other rewarding goals could include playing one song on a musical instrument, or reading one page about travel online, depending on your interests.

Don’t worry if you aren’t able to keep up with your tasks every day. Remind yourself that you’re taking steps to feel better, and that tomorrow is a new day.

Depression likes to do two big things: immobilize and demoralize.

To combat feelings of apathy and self-criticism, finding an activity that you can build up progress with might help.

The benefits of exercise for depression are well-known. Research from2018supports exercise, particularly high intensity exercise, for helping with depression symptoms by reducing inflammation.

By picking an activity you can progress with, you not only set yourself up for the recognized benefits of exercise, you help build up a sense of achievement.

Hate working out? That’s okay.

Not everyone enjoys physical exercise, and doing something you don’t enjoy could only add to feelings of discouragement.If physical activity isn’t your thing, indulging yourartistic sideor your curiosity, might do the trick. Or, you could try reading about sports you like or travel destinations, drawing or writing on a topic of interest, or getting outside to enjoy a hike or easy bike ride.

Ultimately, the goal is to focus on something meaningful toyou. What that means will be different for everyone.

When you learn about depression, you learn there are many people out there also living with it.

You learn that you’re not just “sad.”

You also learn about the many ways depression can besuccessfully treated.

A part of successful treatment is being able to recognize unhelpful thoughts when they appear. This ability isn’t always easy to learn on your own, and often requires working closely with a mental healthcare provider.

Over time, as your skill set increases in this area under professional guidance, you may be able to develop new behaviors to prevent yourself from spiraling into unhelpful thoughts and feelings.

Researchsuggests, the more feel-good things you do, and the more often you do them, the better your chances may be of beating depression in the long term.

You can add positive moments into your day through:

While you’re beating depression, sometimes you may need options to cope with symptoms in the short term.

Since depression likes to steal away your appetite, it can be easy to convince yourself to skip meals. But giving your body nutrients and energy can make a difference to how you feel for the rest of the day.

A 2020systematic reviewfound some promise for the use of healthy diet in depression treatment and prevention.

Research into this area is ongoing, however, and some experts suspect healthy diet impacts depression primarily because people who eat healthy are more likely to have other beneficial mental and physical behaviors.

If you can’t bring yourself to stomach a meal of solid foods, there are a number of meal replacement drinks available that incorporatesuperfoods, probiotics, protein, and carbohydrates.

When you live with depression, you may notice yourpersonal carestarts to decline. You might start by skipping the shower. Brushing your hair may feel like a chore. Maybe you don’t remember when you last brushed your teeth.

A small, cross-sectionalstudyfound married women who self-pampered were less likely to experience depression compared to married women who didn’t self-pamper.

It’s possible, however, like with diet, that people who pamper themselves more are more likely to have other beneficial mental and physical behaviors, which might explain lower rates of depression.

You may have heard about the benefits of sunshine for depression, but2017research suggests just being outside may be enough to improve your mental well-being.

When you set your reminder to “go outside,” it can mean anything from taking a walk to sitting on your doorstep with a cup of coffee.

If you aren’t ready to go outside, bring the outside in.

Astudyfrom 2013 suggested that viewing nature scenes in pictures could help reduce psychological stress, compared to viewing images of manmade, urban scenes. If you want more than pictures on the wall, adding indoor plants or natural building materials could also help.

What To Do When You Feel Hopeless and Depressed #AskATherapist - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=938fs11PyRU

Transcript:
(00:00) pills pills are good well i mean you could take antidepressants if you feel hopeless and depressed there are other things you can try as well let's go through the gamut let's run the gamut i'm jonathan decker manded light [Music] what should you do if you feel hopeless and depressed there are lots of things you can try it's a terrible way to feel by nature we want to feel happy by nature we want to feel hopeful by nature we want to feel like we have a purpose and things to look forward to and a
(00:35) spring in our step and we kind of feel like that should be our default setting or at least like that's what we're working towards and if we're not accomplishing it then there's something wrong with us the first thing to recognize is that there's nothing wrong with you i'm not saying you're not struggling with depression i'm saying that there's nothing wrong with you as a person right you have value you have worth it is limitless it is eternal there's nothing wrong with you morally
(00:58) for feeling hopeless and depressed there's nothing wrong with you in terms of weakness versus strength you're not weak feeling hopeless feeling depressed are natural human feelings everybody feels sad everybody feels down everybody feels weary the issue with depression is that these normal feelings that people have from time to time get blown up get magnified to the point where they drag us down and they keep us from living our lives the way we want to keep us from connecting the way we want to keep us from succeeding the way that
(01:27) we want to like anchors and that is not a moral failing and that is not a lack of strength nobody that i've ever heard of chooses this but we do have to deal with it i've heard it said that your mental health is not your fault but it is your responsibility so what do we do a lot of people run for antidepressants and i'm not anti-antidepressants i think they have their role and for some people they're definitely helpful but i'm going to tell you i'm going to level with you i'm going to tell you my biases today this
(01:56) is what i would do if someone came to me and said i'm feeling depressed i would i'm going to tell you the steps that i would take them through so you could take yourselves through them and i would land on antidepressants at the end if the other stuff isn't working right that's just me another can another clinician might give you a different opinion first of all diet rest and exercise people tell me they're depressed i'm like okay are you getting enough sleep how are you eating are you getting
(02:22) enough exercise and they said they're like my therapist thinks i'm fat and i'm like no it's not that it's got nothing to do with appearance we need to exercise for sanity not for vanity getting a good workout is one of the greatest endorphin boost releases that you can find and for a lot of people sometimes they're self-harm involved right i feel depressed because i feel guilt because i feel shame because i feel nothing because depression isn't always sadness sometimes it's flatness
(02:46) i feel nothing so i want to feel something and self-harm gets involved as a way of feeling something or of relieving guilt by punishing yourself and i tell people you know it's punishing running three miles you know what's punishing doing lunges uh doing the bench press swimming laps that's punishing getting your heart going getting the blood flowing releasing those endorphins is a great way to feel better it's a natural antidepressant finding the right amount of sleep some people feel depressed and hopeless
(03:16) because they work themselves so hard and they drive themselves so hard that they sacrifice sleep and they think that they can handle it the studies are limitless on why we need sleep and you can tell what a big deal it is when you actually start getting good sleep and you can see the difference and you think i should have been doing this all along i should have been making this a priority or what if you're getting too much sleep if you're getting too much sleep or you're spending too much time in bed
(03:43) what i would urge you to do every day even if you just do one thing get out of bed shower and dress if you literally do nothing else that day because you feel too depressed you did something that you didn't want to do because you felt like you should and that's empowering and most people by the time they've gotten out of bed showered and dressed they find that they can at least do something and start getting some things done because they're already dressed for the day and psychologically because they've
(04:11) already made themselves do something that they didn't want to do that they needed to do if you're getting too much sleep have a reason to get out of bed in the morning give yourself that as far as diet is concerned i'm not a nutritionist but i do know enough the more processed foods we eat the more sugar we consume the more things that we put into our bodies that aren't actually food the link between mind and body is strong and eating a lot of junk food eating a lot of fast food is correlated highly with
(04:38) depression eat eat better you don't need to cut off junk food or fast food entirely but use it as a reward or incent or as an incentive once or twice a week and then lay off it if you need something sweet eat fruit if you need something salty eat some peanuts eat some nuts eat some jerky drink a lot of water i know somebody who literally never drinks water they literally only drink dr pepper and mountain dew all the time and they are sad as can be all the time you need to take care of your body because your body and your mind are all
(05:11) part of the same system the next thing i would i would advise you to do is find some purpose sometimes we feel depressed because we don't know what we're doing with ourselves we don't know what our purpose is we feel stuck in the same rut and it's like in the movie unbreakable there's a line where samuel jackson says to bruce willis that little sadness that you have when you wake up every day i think i know what that is maybe you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing look for people to
(05:41) serve if you can't find anybody go to justserve.org and look for service opportunities in your community ways to give back ways to contribute your time ways to help people but honestly the best way to start you know people you have family you have friends that you haven't talked to in a long time some of them are struggling just like you reach out to them being there for somebody can help you to feel better or the flip side allowing them to be there for you if you're feeling depressed if you're feeling hopeless maybe you're
(06:15) disconnected next thing i would advise is to feed your mind if you're spending a lot of time with tv shows with video games with movies look you know me i love screen time as much as anybody but there's such a thing as too much feed your mind with a good book not a trashy beach romance novel i mean maybe there's time for that in your life there's room for that in your life but something that actually lifts you up something that actually helps you to grow something that gives you new skills or new perspective
(06:40) right i would start with a book called man's search for meaning by viktor frankl victor frankel was a holocaust survivor in the most depressing hopeless circumstances you can imagine he was in a concentration camp separated from his family loved ones killed in front of him his home destroyed his possessions taken from him he didn't know if he was going to survive and what his quality of life would be for the rest of his life looked dire and he talks about in that book that the nazis could take away everything
(07:13) they could take away our homes they could take away our families they could take our lives but what they couldn't take was our ability to choose our response to our circumstances he says that in the concentration camps the people who were focused on survivalism and focused on themselves often didn't make it the people who did make it not all the time but if you were to make it is because you were focused on community it's because you were focused on being positive it's because you were focused on i'm gonna make it it's
(07:42) because you were focused on sharing and lifting and helping and using your talents and strengths and being scrappy and being creative and looking for solutions start with that book because when it comes to depressing hopeless circumstances there's no better guide to surviving that and thriving it than man's search for meaning by viktor frankl and then move on move on to tuesdays with maury is another one that i would recommend for a book that helps you find purpose in your life when things are dire when
(08:12) things are sad read good books feed your mind watch listen to podcasts that uplift you follow youtube channels that edify and feed your soul like this one we are all you need everybody else sucks in your face ted talks it's not true i would love to be on a ted talk please that would be amazing [Laughter] now if you are getting enough rest if you are having a healthy diet if you're getting enough exercise if you're fostering connection if you're serving and lifting one another if you're feeding your mind
(08:49) if you're trying to have a purpose if you're looking for a purpose in your life and following that if you're using your talents uh then the next thing i would say is that it's not fake it till you make it but it's similar the behavior precedes the emotion means that oftentimes i have to do something before i feel it i rarely i'm doing a lot better at exercise in my life right now i rarely feel like going to the gym i make myself go even though i don't want to and then once i'm there i start to feel it
(09:15) sometimes i don't feel like interacting with my kids but i make myself play with them and listen to them and connect with them and then i start to enjoy it what i tell people in your shoes is you cannot wait until you feel better to do things you have to do things so that you feel better let me say that again you cannot wait until you feel better to do things you have to do things so that you can feel better and then if that's not working if that's not doing it that's when i would say we turn
(09:41) to antidepressants again you may get a different opinion from a different clinician but that's the order of operations that i see how do you deal with depression how do you deal with hopelessness let me know in the comments below what you think of my thoughts what techniques and strategies that you have used and if you have any questions for this ask a therapist segment leave them down below in the comments and i'll try and hit them up in a future video if you're enjoying this series i want to direct

7 Things To Remember When You're Feeling Depressed - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_01kgwFnw8

Transcript:
(00:00) (upbeat music) - [Narrator] Hi Psych2Goers and welcome to another video. Psych2Go would like to thank you immensely for all the love and support you've given us. Today we explore yet another perspective on a disorder rampant world over. So let's begin. Have you been diagnosed with depression or seriously suspect you might have it? Have you been struggling with feelings of loneliness, emptiness, and hopelessness.
(00:29) Depression is a mood disorder associated with persistently negative feelings that significantly affect your thoughts and behaviors. Depression can happen to anyone at any age, but even as the leading cause of disability in the world with millions suffering from it globally, there are a lot of harmful myths and misconceptions surrounding depression, which makes it an enigma all the more.
(00:50) Before we begin, we request you to not use this video as a medium for self-diagnosis. We aim to help you learn more and to better understand through our videos, inculcating compassion, and being better able to help those suffering. If you resonate with any of the signs mentioned, seeking professional opinions is the way to go.
(01:09) With that said, here are seven things you must remember when feeling depressed. Number one, depression is more than just sadness. Unlike sadness, depression isn't just something you get over or snap yourself out of. Sadness is a part of the natural spectrum of healthy human emotions that all of us experience at certain points in our lives.
(01:30) Everybody gets sad sometimes, but not everyone who does is necessarily depressed. Depression is far more chronic, persistent, and severe than your usual bout of sadness. A depressive episode can last up to months or even years at a time, especially if left untreated and it needs to be treated with the help of a mental health care professional before it can get better.
(01:51) Number two, depression can be sudden. Do the people around you say things like, look around, you have so much to be grateful for, or there's no reason for you to feel depressed? Do you often beat yourself up for feeling depressed just because you think you shouldn't or you don't have any reason to be depressed? Rarely, if ever, does depression seem to have a good reason for it.
(02:13) A person can be wealthy, successful, smart, and attractive, but still suffer from this mental illness. And though a lot of people find it hard to understand why someone with so much to be grateful for would ever fall victim to depression, the terrifying truth is it can happen to just about anyone. Number three, depression is never your fault.
(02:34) Even after endless studies, researchers remain uncertain as to the true nature of depression and the causes behind it. Depression is believed to be caused by a combination of factors that range from biological, such as an imbalance in serotonin and dopamine, genetic, such as having a relative with depression, social such as a lack of close interpersonal relationships, and environmental, like being a victim of child abuse.
(02:58) But none of these are ever your fault. So how are you to blame then? Number four, depression can have different symptoms. Did you know that not everyone displays the same symptoms for depression? It can manifest in a number of different ways and in varying degrees? While some people who are depressed lay in bed all day and sleep, there are those who suffer from insomnia and stay up all night.
(03:22) Some lose their appetite and almost completely stop eating while others start overeating and gain weight instead of losing it. There are times when physical symptoms like fatigue, body aches, and migraines become more prominent than emotional ones, like feelings of worthlessness and loss of motivation and interest, or vice versa.
(03:41) In short, depression doesn't always look the same way for everybody. So when you're feeling depressed, but people keep telling you you seem fine or that there's nothing wrong with you, it does not, in any way, invalidate your feelings. They're still valid. Even if others can't seem to understand what you're going through.
(03:58) Number five, depression, doesn't define who you are. Do you now find yourself learning to live and cope with your depression or does it still consume most of your days? In any case, it's important to never ever lose sight of the fact that your depression does not define you. It does not define your life and it certainly does not make you who you are.
(04:19) There's so much more to you than your mental illness. Some of the most influential and most accomplished people in the world like Abraham Lincoln, Sylvia Plath, and Vincent van Gogh have struggled with depression for most of their lives, but they rose above it all and managed to make their life mean something more.
(04:35) Number six, depression is more common than you think. Have you ever felt like no one on earth could ever understand what you're going through or relate to the things you're thinking or the way you're feeling? If your depression is starting to make you feel more isolated and alone, remind yourself that you're not alone and that there's nothing wrong with you.
(04:56) Depression is actually a lot more common than most people think. Based on a recent survey by the National Institute of Mental Health in 2018, over 25% of people from all around the globe suffer from depression, making it the number one most prevalent mental illness in the world, which brings us to our next point.
(05:14) Number seven, depression is highly treatable. From therapy to medication to self-help. There's a lot of tried and tested treatment options to help those suffering from depression. According to the American Psychiatric Association, over 80 to 90% of those with depression respond well to treatment and learn to manage their symptoms over time.
(05:35) So now you ask why is it still prevalent? The problem is though, of all the people affected by depression, only 43% seek professional help. And we have the countless taboos and stigmas to thank for that. Depression is a very real and very serious mental illness, but you don't have to fight it all on your own.
(05:55) Don't be afraid to ask for help, nor let the stigmas attached deter you. No matter how bad it gets, there's always hope that things can get better. Reaching out to a psychologist or a counselor and getting the help you need can not only improve your life, but also encourage others to break away from the stigmas and seek help.
(06:13) We hope we were able to give you a little insight into the thought process of those who suffer from depression. Do any others come to mind? Let us know in the comments below.

The Hopelessness Theory of Depression - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYdjBAl-JyE

Transcript:
(00:01) Sadness, loneliness and anxiety are normal feelings that everyone has experienced. These feelings can be triggered by specific events, like the loss of a loved one or a humiliating work experience. But when our dark emotional state begins to cause physical symptoms and lasts for long periods of time, it can dramatically affect our everyday behavior and inhibit us from leading normal healthy lives.
(00:25) Despite the social stigma associated with it, major depressive disorder is surprisingly common. Studies show that 13% of the global population will suffer from depression at some point in their lives. And even the World Health Organization considers depression to be a major factor in diseases of all types.
(00:41) Despite depression being seemingly so commonplace, the causes of depression and the different factors that make it more likely to occur are often misunderstood. So, what types of thought processes lead more easily to depressive states and what makes some people more likely than others to suffer from chronic depression? In a landmark 1992 study, Rose and Abramson established a clear link between three pessimistic tendencies, also called negative inferential styles and chronic depression.
(01:10) Number one: Cause. The first occurs when an individual blames global causes for negative life events instead of specific causes. Someone who makes these types of attributions will look at a negative event as caused by something that cannot be changed by them and extends across all areas of their life instead of addressing the specifics of the situation and looking to move forward from it in a positive way.
(01:34) At the same time, they also assume that their successes are one-off situations that are lucky or coincidental and not a result of their own effort and behavior. Number 2: Consequence. Even if someone does not assume that they are the main unchanging cause of negative events in their life, they may still have trouble seeing how a negative situation could turn out positively.
(01:57) People with this outlook on life see the worst in every situation and assume the worst possible outcomes. Even though they might not blame themselves for a particular event, they tell themselves that there's no way to recover from it, believing that they will forever be dealing with the consequences of the negative situation.
(02:15) Number 3: Self-image. Individuals with this third tendency regularly compare themselves with others who are performing better than them in a certain task. Because they view themselves so negatively and believe that they are the cause of every negative life event, they cannot see a way forward from their current situation.
(02:34) They see themselves as the root cause of every issue and so feel a deep sense of hopelessness. Although there are many different factors which contribute to chronic depression, these negative attribution styles always play a major role. Helping individuals who suffer from depression to seek therapy focused on developing more positive ways of thinking, building a strong self-image and better understanding the root causes of their emotions and how to constructively deal with them is an essential part of treatment.
(03:04) As with most illness, the deep shame that accompanies depression can be paralyzing. Please help end the stigma associated with depression and other mental illnesses by coming forward to speak about your own struggles, encouraging others to come forward and always being willing to listen without judgment.





This year didn’t turn out the way most people expected.

The scale of damage during Australia’s bushfire season stunned many, and the first reports ofCOVID-19that followed may have seemed somewhat unreal. You probably didn’t foresee a pandemic shutting down countries around the world or the new turmoil sailing in from every direction.

Quarantine and lockdown, the tragic ongoing loss of Black lives, a highly contentious election season, melting sea ice, a million deaths from COVID-19 (and counting)… The list goes on, overwhelmingly so. In short, 2020 has been a year unlike many that most people can remember.

With no clear end in sight to these increasingly bleak circumstances, you might feel pretty hopeless about things ever returning to normal. And they may not for quite some time.

If that doesn’t sound very hopeful, remember this: Hope is something you can cultivate yourself, regardless of what’s going on around you. Learning to nurture hope and carry it forward can give you the strength to keep going, no matter what the future holds.

Try these seven strategies to replace hopelessness with a renewedsense of optimism.

Hopelessness can make life seem heavy, gray, and dull. The worse you feel, the harder it often becomes to muster up interest in the things you usually enjoy doing.

It’s not always easy to separate general misery into more distinct experiences. You might simply decide you’restressedortiredand leave it at that.

Yet whenrelaxation techniquesormore sleepfail to resolve your distress, you may end up resigning yourself to your new normal. This, unsurprisingly, could leave you feeling even more hopeless. Optimism for the future may seem pretty impossible when you can’t brighten a dismal mood.

The key toregulatingcomplex emotions lies in recognizing and labeling specific emotional states, according to a2018 research review.

Take unhappiness, for example. Digging beneath the surface of this general feeling can help youuncover the layersbelow —loneliness, annoyance, boredom. The more detailed you can get, the easier it becomes to identify the most helpful way of working through those feelings.

Someemotionsyou might be feeling include:

Keeping a mood journalor expressing your feelings through art and music can help you get in better touch with your emotions.

Meditationcan also help you practice acknowledging and accepting uncomfortable feelings instead of instinctively pushing them away.

Most people have plenty to grieve this year. It’s both normal and healthy tomourn losseslarge and small.

Even if you haven’t lost a loved one, you mightgrieve for missed opportunitiesand things you can no longer do. Perhaps you had to cancel your wedding or long-awaited vacation, or you lost your home or income. Maybe you needed to completely alter your way of life.

Complicating your grief might be the fact that the pandemic — or another complex situation you’re living with — still continues. How can you stop grieving if your loss is incomplete?

Here, too,naming your lossescan help. Even if you know you’ll continue to grieve, acknowledging the pain and giving yourself the chance to fully experience your feelings can help you begin letting them go and looking forward with renewed optimism.

This acknowledgement might look something like these examples:

Above all, remember that good things happened before, and they will again — even if they look a little different from what you’d envisioned.

When it comes to global or even nationwide concerns, there’s only so much one person can do. But even drops fill a bucket eventually.

Your actions might seem insignificant, but they can still have an impact. And where you can’t take any concrete action, your voice alone can make a difference.

The insidious mutter of hopelessness might tell you, “We’re all doomed, so what’s the point?” Yet change remains possible until the moment you give up.

So,speak out against racismand other injustice. Be a champion for kindness and compassion. Recycle, conserve energy, and consider your environmental impact.

Look into other ways to make a difference, and encourage others to do the same.

Stayinganchoredin the present moment and letting yourself experience things as they happen can help you begin to confront feelings of hopelessness.

You might wonder, “Won’t tuning into my hopelessness just leave me feeling worse?”

Generally speaking, no.

When you increase your awareness of the specific things currently troubling you, identifying helpful solutions for the moment becomes easier.

Staying present also helps you pay more attention to the good things in your life and find meaning insmall daily joys. When you fixate on things that have already happened or things that might happen in the future, these positive moments often get swept away by the tide of negativity and distress.

For most people, 2020’s particular brand of hopelessness stems from multiple factors. Your worries probably don’t just center around COVID-19, the potential demise of your career field, or the loss of your social life. You might also have concerns aboutclimate changeand racism.

The monumental size of these issues can give rise tofatalistic thinkingas you begin to wonder, “Why bother trying, if there’s nothing I can do?”

Instead of worrying about future possibilities that haven’t yet come to pass, explore ways to feel better right now — because that’s where you can really make an immediate impact.

Even when you can’t do much to feel better, you can usually dosomething.Being presentmakes it easier to address challenges one step at a time and recognize small ways to achieve your goals and create change. You learn where you do have some measure of control and when it’s better to let things go.

Choosing to take good care of yourself can also help you regain control over spiraling thoughts of hopelessness. Goodself-care practicescan boost your energy and leave you feeling more capable of facing challenges to come.

While self-care can mean eating balanced meals, staying active, and getting enough sleep, it also meanstaking breakswhen needed and cutting yourself some slack.

Devoting your attention to the causes that matter to you can ease feelings of hopelessness, but it’s important to avoid doing too much. You can’t show up for yourself, or anyone else, if you burn out.

Making time for hobbies and activities you enjoy is one healthy way to find balance.

You might want to stay informed on current events, but it’s wise to detach from theconstant streamof news and social media and spend timeenjoying nature, catching up with loved ones, or curling up with good book (or even avideo game).

There’s no denying the pandemic’s impact on things like:

The inability to spend in-person time with loved ones has left many people feeling lonelier than ever before, and loneliness often adds more fuel to a lingering sense of hopelessness.

It might take a little more maintenance to keepfriendships and relationshipsthriving, but with effort, you might end up feeling even more connected to the people you consider most important.

Maybe you can’t throw a party, but you can still:

Talking through distress can lighten your burden, but it’s worth considering that loved ones might be grappling with similar emotions. Opening up gives them a chance to share their own struggles so you cansupport each other.

Looking formore ways to connect? Maximize the benefits of technology throughvirtual volunteeringor online book or movie clubs.

Hopelessness may not be a specific mental health diagnosis, but it can still have a pretty significant impact on your health and well-being. Persistent hopelessness might affect your sleep and appetite or play a part indepressionandthoughts of suicide.

While coping strategies often help ease emotional distress, they may not always work. That doesn’t mean you’ve failed or done anything wrong, only that you might benefit from a little extra support.

A therapist can help you uncover the roots of hopelessness and explore ways to address the things you can change. Even more importantly, they can teach you skills to accept andmanage the difficult feelingsthat accompany challenges you can’t do anything about.

Our guide to affordable therapy can help you get started.

When a difficult situation never seems to improve, when each new loss follows closely on the heels of the last, it’s easy to throw up your hands and say, “There’s nothing I can do.”

No one knows what the future holds, and these “unprecedented times” are far from over. Self-compassion and kindness can help you support yourself through the darkest moments, and the rekindling of hope lies in action, however small.

It’s not easy when life’s challenges seem to come all at once. They can make you feel caught up in youremotions, and it's common to experience a sense of hopelessness. However, even during trying times, it can be possible to guide yourself toward hope. We look at the causes of feeling hopeless and the actionable steps you can take to support yourself.

Feeling hopeless is when you start to believe that things just won’t get better, no matter what.

When you feel hopeless, you might stop looking forward to things you’d normally enjoy. The feeling of hopelessness can make it tough to get out of bed in the morning, enjoy time with friends, or focus on work or hobbies.

Look for professional support if hopelessness persists or significantly impacts your daily life, as these feelings may signal underlying issues such as depression.

Hopelessness anddepressionare related, but they’re not the same thing. Hopelessness can be a feeling or a temporary state of mind, while depression is a medical condition that can affect how you feel, think, and act over a longer period. However, persistent feelings of hopelessness can be a symptom of depression. It's important to talk to a healthcare professional if you're experiencing ongoing hopelessness, especially if it's interfering with your life or you have other symptoms of depression.

What works in overcoming hopelessness can vary from person to person. However, some general steps include:practicing mindfulnessto stay present, connecting with supportive people, exploring new hobbies, exercising, andpracticing gratitude. It's also crucial to seek professional help if you're finding it difficult to manage feelings of hopelessness on your own.

Feeling like you have no future can be challenging andoverwhelming. Talking about these feelings with someone you trust or a mental health professional can be helpful. Seeking support and discussing your feelings is a powerful step toward finding hope again.

Additionally, engaging in activities that provide a sense of purpose or achievement, learning new skills, and setting small, achievable goals can also help build a positive outlook toward the future.

Why do I feel like nothing matters?

why nothing really excites us anymore - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:01) so this is like what's happening in your brain most the time that you're consuming content your brain looks like this when you look like this [Music] and I gotta be honest with you recently I've noticed something strange is kind of happening to me seems like the things that used to excite me aren't getting the job done anymore in this video I want a mission to discover why that is and how to enjoy things again [Music] hey guys it's Tonio I want to start by asking you a simple question when's the
(00:36) last time you got level 10 excited or like a show a movie an album drop or some other piece of content I'm not talking like oh I'm so excited for like the new episode of Mandalorian to draw excited for Drake's new album I'm excited for like you know iCarly I don't know what you get excited about but I'm not talking about casually excited I'm talking about level 10 hyping yourself up before putting yourself in group text with friends about the release and talking about it to get excited going
(01:03) and waiting in line at midnight for the game to get excited chances are if you're like me it may have been a while I realized things that were at one point super exciting are no longer as exciting I already know what you're thinking well that's just part of growing up that's just part of being an adult I do believe that's true to a degree but I think that's only half of the equation you see what I believe to have discovered is another half of the equation that is completely in our control see by the end
(01:28) of this video I think you're gonna walk away with a new Joy a new fire a new excitement for things that have lost their flavor and have just grown Bland to you I'm on a mission to get the level 10 excitement back in my life not just for Content but for life in general in order to discover where it disappeared to you have to look at where it began let's go back to may have guessed it our childhood see you there [Music] Nostalgia time nothing like waking up on a hot summer day it's smelling some fresh Play-Doh
(02:02) remember these guys and while you're outside why don't you pick up one of these who could forget I went to war with these things uh oh the nostalgia's hitting hard remember this standy thing you would stand on yeah I read these looks but like to my little brother though because I was too old to read them nope I never got hit by one of these and cried so hard that my mom had to come and pick me up never Legend of Zelda this Rings back good memories right here it's cozy the true and telling sign of
(02:25) the early 2000s has not been revealed yet are you ready for it three two Blockbusters or ladies and gentlemen what you have to understand about this place is that little Tonio yes this little Oompa Loompa right here make a video put it on Windows Movie making like edited and stuff you want to break let's do it could not wait to go to Blockbuster because it meant that he was gonna get his hands on either a brand new movie or a brand new game was it his to own you ask absolutely not did he only have it for a very limited amount
(02:53) of time absolutely but dang it he had it so I decided it was time to take a journey back to that old Blockbuster and check in on everybody I was super excited but then something happened that made me say what the heck Arby's apparently wagyu is back I pulled up to the old building it used to be a blockbuster into my Devastation it's now a U.
(03:13) S cellular are you kidding me right now there were literally only like two cars in the parking lot I had to go and confront these people I had a game plan I was gonna ask for the manager and Go full Karen on it was closed because it's a Sunday afternoon this left me with a lot to think about [Music] well that building used to be where I would go and get all my movies and overpriced video game rentals I have such good memories of this place I couldn't wait to sit down with my family and like all watch a movie together I don't know it just feels kind of weird
(03:42) thinking about those old memories just how different things are now I know what you're thinking Antonio Blockbuster is gone the death of Blockbuster is more symbolic than you might realize death of Blockbuster was the end of an era the beginning of a new one it looks like Netflix has got an you know another pretty good winner on his hands it was the beginning the instant gratification era wait for your show you don't have to wait for anything you can have it when you want it how you want it as fast as you want
(04:12) it as slow as you want it new word was introduced into our vocabularies that word is binge you want to sit down and watch eight hours straight of something go right ahead because you can never have too much of a good thing right right right so I picked up this iced coffee thank you so much it's gonna help me illustrate the point I'm trying to make here see um there's this lie that a lot of us believe and um I think it's a lie that our culture believes which is this you can never have too much of a good thing it's not
(04:43) true but my mom growing up she would always tell me she would say too much of a good thing can easily become a bad thing she was mostly telling that to me because I was a chunky little guy I would eat like too many donuts and she'd be like too much of a good thing it's a bad thing I'd be like but there is a ton of Truth to what she said back to the iced coffee for example I love ice coffee always brightens my day I feel like I'm going on a little Adventure when I go and get one since I've become
(05:07) an adult I've started getting an iced coffee every single day I'm so sorry Dave what eventually happened that something that at one point excited me now feels normal to me see when we have too much of a good thing when we grow too comfortable with something we tend to devalue that very thing I think that is exactly what we have done with content give unlimited access to all of these shows and movies all of this food if you've ever taken basic economics what you know is that if Supply increases and demand stays the
(05:37) same the price where the value goes down I think that's the problem there's too much hear me out I think it's great that there's all this content I think people should keep on creating I think it's good I think the problem lies with how much content there is I think the problem lies with how much we consume of it without any sort of boundaries so now that we understand that part of this problem is that we're simply just consuming too much content that we're growing numb to things that we should be
(06:00) excited about time to talk about what the solution to this thing is needed to make a phone call to help me remember hello why are you laughing dude you called in the worst time possible what's happening you're in the middle of a boss fight I'm in a boss fight so remember when we were talking the other night uh like on on my porch about like content and like the video games and all that kind of stuff yeah what was the thing we were talking about pain we had some line that we came up with what was the thing we're talking
(06:31) about only way to get through pain is to go through pain yes that's it the only way to avoid pain is through pain okay dude thank you so much all right so the only way to avoid pain is through pain I'm going somewhere with this and it's going to be good let me break it down for you really quick these are cat miles look I'm not a big cat guy but my wife is so we love them this is our son Easton now Easton loves bullying miles as you can see he's doing here but we get on to Easton and we tell
(07:01) him no which usually results in him crying our no is painful to him but as his parents we know that that pain is no match to the pain of Miles he's lashing his eye out as silly of an illustration as this is I think that we have to understand in life we have to pick our pain so applying this principle here's how I began to get the excitement and joy back into my life I've restricted myself and it's painful I made a rule that I'm only gonna watch one show at a time I'm only gonna play one game at a
(07:33) time that I'm only gonna consume one piece of content at a time there may be an unlimited amount of Supply out there but I'm limiting what comes in so if I'm watching a show not on my phone don't watch another show till that one's done I want to challenge you to limit yourself because you may be surprised at the results as honest I've started to enjoy things like I used to we're showing up to GameStop at 11 PM at night because the new Zelda is coming I never want to get too old too cool or too numb
(07:59) wait in a line have some friends over and make the most out of these moments of Life absolutely insane absolutely insane fully immersed we got Wings right here all the wings you may be losing time but you don't have to lose your joy if you feel so far gone you can't even focus on anything at all then click on this video because it's for you


Nothing Matters and That's Okay - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp7PkhHKu3M

Transcript:
(00:05) [Music] [Music] so here's the deal I was writing a silly script for this video the whole premise was gonna be hey nothing is real nothing matters since son of your decisions have any weight or consequence there's no reason why you shouldn't check out my merch store with crowd made and that sort of thing is gonna be a very serious video in the beginning in the middle and then the gag would be hey go buy my merch since nothing matters you know the thing is though is I was writing that video listing off all these depressing
(00:49) true facts and surface-level nihilistic philosophical anecdotes it felt wrong and off not the merch plug at the end by all means please go check out my merch we got pans we got really cool raccoon tour beanie and just you know new designs on the way now it was the ramblings that started bumming me out I've recently been through what have probably been the worst few months of my life period I was kicked out of that house that I was so in love with a few months back so much of my time money was sent down the drain by someone else's
(01:16) decision I've lost pets I've lost friends safe spaces support systems and I've pretty much lost all of my motivation do anything on top of this horrible pandemic thing going on - I've been stuck at home just marinating in my own misery these past few weeks with no escape and in my brain there's this little black door and behind it is the nasty rationalization of absurdism the understanding that the universe is cold and random and uncaring children die horribly wars are fought over whose imaginary friend is more real than the
(01:45) other genocide rape murder new releases from the Red Hot Chili Peppers every single day horrible atrocities you can't even imagine are committed and there is no cosmic punishment no Karma know anything that's taking charge and acting as judge the most evil heinous people end up in the same place that the best people go oblivion nowhere nothingness I've talked about this in past videos plenty and if you're a longtime viewer of my content you already know that this stuff freaks me out normally I have
(02:12) three support systems I put in front of that awful door art friends and community but when I lose all motivation do art when I lose all my trust with my best friends who I thought I could depend on and when the community that I belong to doesn't feel safe anymore there's nothing distracting me from that nasty horrible door that's just always looming in the back of my head at the end of the day there's a strong argument for the gesture that everything we do is to avoid facing the inevitability of
(02:36) oblivion this is called terror management theory and this line of thinking was popular by Ernest Becker who wrote the book the denial of death religion was designed to manipulate the fear of death into political power society was designed to subvert it and philosophy was created to understand it we have speed limits in place because time is a valuable asset and we value life over the alternative which is haunting and scary stuff like that human beings are the only creatures to understand the Oblivion that they
(03:01) face and they're also the only ones to try and conquer it with civilizations medical studies and stories to chase some form of immortality wheezes species have built systems that are ultimately meaningless but works that we have things to invest our attention into that's not you know the fact that someday this will all be gone and we won't be around to think to remember it anymore there will not be any form of us to recall this stuff you know we often imagine the end of the world being some fiery hell storm of nuclear proportions
(03:27) there's gonna be famine climate change a Democratic nomination going to Joe Biden here's a fun fact the climate and atmospheric sciences Department and the University of California currently is served that there's a 1 and 20 chance that humanity will be wiped out by the year 2100 that means that you are more likely to die in the apocalypse than you are to be killed by a car wreck but there's a very real argument that the end of the world will not take place with bombs or global warming or even a
(03:51) pandemic but rather something quieter and smaller you resting in a hospital bed surrounded by loved ones huddled around you one of your children holding your hand is a heart monitor beeps to your left and your vision starts to blur into a white haze your head gets fuzzy and it burns a little you feel dizzy as if you're floating or tipsy senses a memory begin to fade and peel away as the world evaporates around you your entire life all that you've known has been your own perception once that's turned off like a computer motherboard
(04:19) who's to say but that isn't equivalent to your own tiny apocalypse now this is some pretty heavy stuff that's digging into the existential foundations of everyday life I don't expect everyone to have a hundred percent grasp on the serious implications of terror management theory trust me I've read the comments a lot of you left on my religion video some of y'all are pretty dumb some folks are content accepting that the world outside of themselves matters beyond their own perception of it so
(04:47) then let me extend the theory to a larger scale the fate of the universe eventually everything that has ever existed and will ever exist will be swallowed by black holes then those black holes will evaporate and all of time and space will be nothing the universe will continue to expand for all of eternity there will still be neutrinos electrons photons and positrons floating around but they will be too far apart to interact or do anything meaningful this will be the dark era of the universe and as far as we're aware that's it nothing comes
(05:15) after that ever we are completely powerless to it and this isn't a hypothetical or anything this is real and it's going to happen eventually you are going to die there is no heaven there is no hell there is no cosmic grand purpose for why bad things have happened to you your family or the world around you every single day the lives that we lead and human civilization is not headed for some grand final destination that's meaningful and permanent this isn't like Breaking Bad where everything is leading up to a stellar
(05:43) finale where everything just makes sense and it all justifies its own existence hell the most realistic semblance of meaning for us will probably be inadvertently creating a god like AI that surpasses us and becomes the most sophisticated life force in the universe if you really want to get big picture with this whole thing we are probably just an extended prologue for another species grand epic cosmic story we are to the computer race what trillions of cells in the pre-stored gene pool are to us this stuff is really sad to
(06:11) rationalize and think about and if this doesn't scare you deep down you haven't spent enough time marinating on it Ernest Becker states that everybody is horrified of these implications if you dig deep enough past all the delusions in ego so that brings us to this question since everything is horrible why do anything that is a question that plagues a lot of people when they're presented with it especially if they come from a religious background if our consciousness is all that we can objectively prove to exist and we know
(06:37) for a fact that is all going to come to an end why is it worth working through the depressing stuff if the universe is gonna dissipate into nothingness why spend time and effort building anything if nothing matters in the end why do we bother doing anything I think the answer is simple it's because we have no choice in the matter all that you get at the end of the day is this time you do not have anything else you can't take the phone you're watching this video on with you when you die your day-to-day experiences are the
(07:05) only things that are 100% yours and they're all that you will ever have so it begs the question why would you waste your time worrying about something that you can't control you see I was brought into this world without permission and I was tasked with thousands of responsibilities that I didn't ask for all contributing to this giant socio-economic system that's kind of pointless in the grand scheme of things so of course I can be miserable and mad and angsty about that but what good does it do me if anything being conscious and
(07:33) aware of that and fixating on it does me absolutely no favors the beginning of my life is set in stone the ending of my life is not going to change what I have is the middle stuff to occupy my attention and time and I don't want to waste that I've been fixated on a lot of the bad stuff it happens to me over the past few months that I mentioned at the beginning of this video it caused me to spend some time in some really nasty introspection on this kind of stuff and to be transparent this video is kind of
(07:58) in itself me working through this stuff out loud but sometimes by putting things into perspective you can get a little fire under your butt so there's this big black scary chasm waiting for you in a few decades awesome here are some stuff that you can do in the meantime while you still can here are some people to make friends with here's some amazing food excellent shows amazing movies and places to see before you can't anymore if everything was gonna last forever I don't know how I would have the
(08:23) motivation to do anything knowing that it was gonna be there tomorrow death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit as one guy said he's not important nothing matters and nothing you ever do say or think changes that but you can find either liberation and motivation in that inevitability or you can let it crush you for me I want to use this time to become a better artist and eventually quit drawing stick figures this isn't a stylistic thing I just can't draw I would love to learn to animate and work on a studio someday I
(08:53) want to play music and write someone else's favorite song I want to move somewhere with someone I love and make money and live in a home and play the stupid capitalist game I want to work as a high school teacher when I'm old and I want to have hundreds of cool stories to tell my students about my life I want to be a super cool uncle to my nephew and hopefully be a good father to children there is so much stuff that I want to accomplish and death is the thing driving me to get them all done in a timely manner terror management can be
(09:20) pretty scary but if it wasn't would you care about anything I know that my videos can bum people out from time to time but I hope that most of you let these kinds of meditations serve as a driving force for you to do amazing things please get out there pick yourself up however you can do everything in your power to make your ride into nothingness as exciting and wonderful as possible when you're on that hospital bed surrounded by your loved ones fading into that colorless void I hope it's not an event filled with regret and fear and
(09:49) hopelessness I hope you'll be able to view it as welcome rest after a long life of yelling into the void I hope you accomplish everything that you want in life I really do please stay safe stay motivated and stay spicy I'll see you around [Music]



When you feel like you don’t matter, it’stemptingto express your doubts to someone else.

The common response? “Well, of course, you matter! Stop being so dramatic.”

And just like that, they’veinvalidated your feelings(with the best intentions) and left you feeling more alone than ever.

If you’re wondering, “How do I know if I matter?” we’re glad you’re here.

We know the feeling well —sowell, in fact, that we’ve collected 15 answers to that question.

And unlike thoseintrusive thoughts, all of them are true.

Let’s start with a list of possible reasons why you feel you don’t matter.

More than one of the following might help explain the maelstrom of dark thoughts and painful emotions you’re experiencing right now:

You also need to take into account how long you’ve been telling yourself things like, “My life doesn’t matter” or “My opinion doesn’t matter.”

You need to know whether this is something relatively new for you or something you’ve been living with for years, possibly for as long as you can remember.

The treatment should address the whole picture.

You’re telling yourself, “I don’t feel important,” because your own thoughts have driven you to that conclusion. And those thoughts come from your beliefs…

The fact is most, if not all, of us, grow up hearing lies about ourselves and other people. We mistake them for truths and refer to authoritative texts that support them.

It takes a monumental effort to challenge those ideas and reclaim our true identity.

The effort comes in the day-to-day renewal of our intention to see ourselves as we are — not as other people see us and not as we’ve been taught to see ourselves.

If your knee-jerk answer to the question, “Do I matter?” is a half-hearted shrug or a “Probably not,” you need to read these 15 reasons you most definitelydomatter — more than you realize.

Some will speak louder to you than others.

Everyone has the same universal pain points — self-doubt, insecurity, and fear of not belonging. Some are better at hiding it than others, but we all have emotional wounds that flare up at the slightest touch.

Your past holds clues to your triggers, but we all have memories we’d like to erase.

The more you hold onto your painful interpretations of those memories, the stronger your reaction to each trigger.

As mentioned above, we all grow up learning ideas about ourselves and other people that are based on flawed texts and age-old scripts that are only around because enough people still believe in them.

You don’t have to accept them, though.

Start with what you know to be true (not what you were taught to believe), and build on it by getting to know yourself and developing your gifts.

Everyone has at least one thing they’re better at than most. What’s your thing?

Make a list of accomplishments and other moments you swelled with pride and felt good about yourself. What do those have in common? What do you enjoy doing even if no one pays you to do it?

Spend some time reacquainting yourself with what you’re good at and what lights you up inside.

Everything you’ve experienced so far can teach you something about yourself.

But since you’re probably used to interpreting every experience using the lens of self-sabotaging beliefs, you don’t allow yourself to benefit from those lessons.

It’s time to change that. Brainstorm a list of memorable experiences and ask yourself what you can learn from them.

Be honest about how you’ve interpreted them and choose to see them as learning experiences.

Even the lowest points in your life can tell you things you need to know about yourself, about your place in the world, and about what you can do to make it better.

Think of one of these low points and review your interpretation of it and how that’s affected you.

Chances are good that you’ve chosen to use that experience to justify painful and untrue beliefs about yourself. But you can choose differently.

What others think of you is more about them than it is about you. Their perception of you depends on what they believe about themselves.

We all have different movies playing in our heads. Yours will be different from anyone else’s. Think of the internal slideshow when you listen to your favorite songs.

Scenes from your own life flash before your eyes, and you choose the soundtrack and captioning.

Your inner critic echoes your beliefs and is quick to reiterate the worst of these whenever you make a mistake. It knows just what buttons to push to hurt you most.

It’s worth remembering that what it says is usually not true. When it doesn’t lie outright, it takes a truth, distorts it into something only partially true, and exaggerates the untrue element to a painful extreme. The best way to counter this voice is with a simple truth.

It just helps you narrow down your options. Even if a lot of doors slam in your face, you can choose how to interpret those.

Otherpeople’s rejectionof you has more to do with them than with you, anyway.

So, instead of taking it personally, take it as a road sign. Use it to help you choose your direction from that point forward.

Are You Socially Inept? 25 Of The Best Ways To Know For Sure

13 Proven Actions To Get Out of Your Head

15 Of The Best Responses When Someone Talks Down To You

Getting your way all the time is overrated. So is having everyone around you tell you how great you are.

Not everyone will like you, and you need to be both aware of that and accept it without judging yourself or them.

The ability toget back upwhen someone has knocked you down (not literally, we hope) and get moving again will do you more good than being protected from criticism.

You need to know you’re not alone infeeling you don’t matteror that your ideas don’t matter, or that your feelings don’t matter.

And you don’t have to deal with those feelings alone if you don’t want to.

It can help to talk to someone who will listen quietly and then help you get to the root of those thoughts, so you can see and embrace the truth about yourself instead.

If you want to believe you’re broken, just know that you’re no more broken than most other people on the planet. We all have our cracks. But your imperfections don’t make you any less worthy of love or less valuable to the world.

If anything, the wounds you bear help youfulfill your purpose, as long as you see them for what they are. Whatever strips you of illusions can help you see your way more clearly.

People will say mean things to you along the way. They’ll seesomething in you they don’t like— something that feels to them like a personal affront — and they’ll call you out for it.

They’ll judge you and say they’re just “being honest.”

The lies we believe about ourselves influence how we see other people and behave towards them. How others treat you is about them andtheir beliefs— not you.

You don’t have to do something worth recording in a history book for your life to be worth something. However small it may seem to you, your influence on others is something only you can give.

Your actions and accomplishments may seem insignificant when you’re feeling low. But, as you learned in school, every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

Every achievement leads to others.

You don’t know what your influence on the people around you might lead to. Oneencouraging messagefrom you could make all the difference in someone’s life.

Your impact may seem slight to you, but as it radiates outward, it grows and takes on a life of its own. Without you, legions of small but important changes would never happen.

Focus on doing as much good as you can.

You don’t have to have always been confident growing up. And yourlack of confidencein the past doesn’t limit your ability to be confident in the present or future.

You can choose to be confident in your bearing, in your words, and your self-talk. No one gets to hold you back if you don’t let them.

Learn what it means to be confident, and make it a priority.

Which of these 15 reminders of why your life matters stood out for you? And what will you do this week to address the self-talk behind your torment?

Take a closer look at your beliefs, and be honest about which ones support the idea that your life is of little value to the world.

Take a look, too, at the company you keep, the books you read, and the things you listen to. Anything that tells you you’re too flawed to matter deserves the hell it creates.

You deserve better.

The feeling of emptiness is stark in contrast to the emotions that a person is supposed to feel. It sits like a black hole in your chest, devoid of the substance that is supposed to be there.

It dulls emotions, interests, desires, hopes, dreams, and can even go beyond what we expect from negative emotions. The emptiness can eat sadness just as easily as happiness and hope, leaving you feeling barren and void.

To call emptiness a negative feeling may not feel correct, as it is a strong, palpable sense of nothingness. It certainly doesn’t feel positive, but it may not feel negative either. It’s just absent.

You may feel like nothing matters, everything is boring, or that you can’t feel any sort of strong emotions.

Despite that absence, the feeling of nothing is actually an emotion communicating something to you about yourself, your health, or the way you’re living your life.

Humans are creatures that thrive in the vibrancy of emotions and the energy they bring. The absence of that energy can be so crushing when you live with it often or have never experienced it. If you’ve never experienced emptiness before, it can be incredibly alarming to feel nothing when you’re supposed to feel everything, or at least something.

People choose to deal with that emptiness in different ways, many of them not healthy. We may try to fill that hole with sex, money, consumerism, video games, distractions, drugs, alcohol, and in more extreme cases – self-harm and even suicide. After all, the physical pain is at least a reminder we’re still alive, can still feel… something.

Anything at all.

But it doesn’t have to be that way. Emptiness is a symptom pointing toward a larger problem that the person may not realize they are experiencing.

That problem isn’t always mental illness either. There are a variety of circumstances and problems that can cause that feeling of emptiness.

The cause of the emptiness will dictate what kind of actions may help alleviate that feeling. In this article, we will discuss some of the common causes and some suggested solutions for addressing that empty feeling.

Emptiness can be a difficult thing to tackle on your own. It’s a problem that may be best tackled with a trained mental health therapist, particularly if you have a mental illness that can cause these types of feelings. Don’t hesitate to seek out professional help, particularly if you’re experiencing prolonged periods of emptiness.

Speak to an accredited and experienced therapist to help you figure out why you’re feeling empty and to tackle the issue head on. You may want to tryspeaking to one via BetterHelp.comfor quality care at its most convenient.

Many people struggle with finding a sense of purpose in this vast universe of limitless possibilities.

What do I do with my life? Does this mean anything? What should I be doing with myself?

The existential dread that comes with lacking purpose can fuel emptiness as it feels like we are missing something we are supposed to have. Some people try to fill the emptiness with their actions, like doing volunteer work or getting a job in a field that can help people.

Seeking purpose is an interesting matter because you may not be ready to find a particular purpose. And we don’t mean that in an abstract, destiny kind of sense.Instead, there might be life experiences you need to have and work you need to do before a fulfilling purpose can click with you.

Perhaps being a parent offers you the kind of fulfillment that would fill that emptiness, but you wouldn’t necessarily know that until after you have a child. Or maybe it’s something more career-focused. Maybe your heart and mind are in tune with being on the sea, something you may not know until you set foot on a boat.

You may even feel a pull toward something that could offer you fulfillment, like a persistent interest or something that really speaks to you. That could help you find a direction.

Grief is a natural emotional reaction to the death of a loved one. Sometimes we can see the end coming and have some time to mentally and emotionally prepare for it. Other times we may lose a loved one unexpectedly. There is always a flood of emotions to deal with when a death occurs, even if it’s not immediate.

Many people turn togrief modelsto better try to process and understand their grief without really understanding the models. The “Five Stages of Grief” is one such model. What people tend to get wrong about these models is that they are not hard and fast rules. It’s impossible to shove the full scope of emotions into such a narrow box, a fact that the creators of such models regularly talk about.

They may serve as a general guideline. There are stages that you may or may not experience. Some people experience multiple stages at the same time. Others bounce around through different stages as they are mourning their loved one.

Many of the models talk about “numbness” or “denial” as being involved in the grief process and this might explain the emptiness you feel.It can be a difficult experience because, rationally, you know that you should probably be feeling sadness along with lots of other emotions, but you don’t and that’s hard to reconcile.

Grief and mourning are more complicated than they appear. That makes it a good idea to seek a grief counselor. A grief specialist may be able to help you through those persistent empty feelings and mourning.

Many people turn to drugs and alcohol to cope with the traumas of their life. There’s nothing inherently wrong with periodically having a drink or using legal substances. The problems really start to pick up when those substances are used excessively or as a way to help moderate one’s emotions.

Filling the void of emptiness with a substance can lead to addiction, worse relationships with other people, losing jobs, and changing life circumstances.

Substance abuse can also lead to different physical or mental health issues, other than substance abuse disorder, like sparking a latent mental illness or liver disease. It may also make preexisting health issues worse.

Alcohol is known to impact people with mood disorders, like depression and bipolar disorder, far more severely than people without. It just works differently in their minds and may fuel emotional instability and make depression worse.

One of the reasons people use substances is to help them survive something they are going through. They believe it helps them because it calms them down at the moment. The problem is that extended substance use can have long-term effects that can worsen mental health issues or cause new ones to crop up in the future.

Humans aren’t built to cope with long-term stresses well. Stress causes different hormones to be produced to help a person get through that immediate stressful situation, but those hormones can cause more significant problems the longer they are present.

Long-term stresses can cause depression, anxiety, and in some cases, PTSD. Survivors of domestic abuse, child abuse, and poverty may develop Complex PTSD, which results from never really getting a break from the circumstances they survived.

Avoiding long-term stresses or changing living situations may help. But if mental health problems have developed, it will require a trained mental health professional to heal and recover from.

The people around us severely impact our mental and emotional state. Emptiness can be fueled by tumultuous relationships, estrangement, or just the stresses that our loved ones sometimes cause us. It gets much harder to maintain your own mental health when someone you love is suffering or making bad decisions.

Romantic relationships can bring all kinds of additional stresses that may fuel that emptiness.Perhaps the partner has problems they aren’t addressing. You may not be on good terms with their family, which is a source of stress and difficulty. It may also be that the relationship is waning and on its way toward ending. That kind of heartbreak when things don’t work out can always fuel some negativity.

These issues may need to be worked out personally or even with the help of a relationship counselor. Of course, there are also some issues that you just can’t fix, and you may need to reevaluate whether or not the relationship is healthy for you to remain in.

In recent years, the adverse effects of excessive social media use are starting to come to light. Being continually bombarded with negative news and the highlight reels of the lives of others is fueling massive insecurities, personality disorders, depression, anxiety, and a host of other issues.

It turns out that’s not a good combination when your life may be less than the perfection that many people using social media choose to portray.

That’s not even counting the scummier parts of social media. Social media companies incorporate the human dopamine reward system and Fear Of Missing Out to keep you scrolling to fuel engagement and collect likes.

Like all things, social media needs to be used in moderation if it’s going to be used. Too much is not mentally healthy and can fuel negative feelings like emptiness.

Much like social media, excessive media use can do similar things.

How many jokes or references have you heard of people binge-watching entire seasons of shows on streaming services? That type of behavior is not healthy because it lets us zone out into what we’re watching instead of dealing with the life going on around us.

That kind of behavior facilitates negative emotions like emptiness, but it causes additional complications in life because we may not be paying attention to our responsibilities.

Video games act the same way. It’s so easy to get sucked into a video game designed to be a time-sink to keep you engaged and keep you regularly playing. MMORPGs (Massive Multiplayer Online RolePlaying Games) and MOBAs (Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas) are game genres designed to be treadmills that never end.

Sure, they’re a fun way to pass some time. But using video games as an escape from real life can cause video game addiction in a similar way to gambling addiction. You get hooked on tangible reward loops and just keep coming back for more.

There’s nothing wrong with these things in moderation, but one does need to exercise moderation to avoid making their mental health worse.

Life changes and transitions bring with them stresses that can be difficult to deal with. Sometimes these are planned, and sometimes they are thrust upon us by a job loss, relationship ending, changing of housing, or some other serious occurrence.

It’s normal to be stressed and uncomfortable when going through a transition like this, mainly if you aren’t sure where your future leads.

The overwhelming nature of these changes can cause your brain to want to shut down and avoid stress. Those feelings can include emptiness.

You may find that the emptiness passes after the situation is resolved and you’re moving on to something else.

Yes, you may have lost a job, but you put in some applications and have an interview lined up. Relationships end, and that’s unfortunate, but there’s always the chance to find a new opportunity and a better love that fits the person you’re growing into.

These transitions will pass, and you will find your way. Sometimes we just need to have a little patience while our life is burning down around us.

Few weights are heavier than regret. Everyone has something that they wish they would have done differently or done at all. Sometimes people have far more than one or two of those regrets stewing quietly in their minds.

Dwelling in that past and the thoughts of what could have been can easily cause negative emotions like sadness, regret, mourning, and emptiness.

Time doesn’t necessarily heal all wounds. Sometimes, it just compounds them and makes them worse if we haven’t found a way to actively deal with them and heal from them.

That may require the help of a therapist to find acceptance for what was and didn’t come to be so that you can look forward to better things for your present and future.

Spiritual health does not mean religion or a religious type of spirituality. Instead, it’s a phrase that the medical community uses to describe the emotional self’s intangible aspects.

Spiritual health encompasses things that make us feel whole, happy, good, or complete.

Some people use religion to find that kind of feeling, but it can also be found in volunteer work, creating art, doing good for other people, nurturing loving relationships, being out in nature, and so many other things.

We live busy lives where there is always something to be done. There rarely seems to be enough hours in the day to get everything accomplished. That leaves little time for recreation and fulfilling our spiritual side unless we purposefully create time for play.

Trying to be on the unending grind with no breaks, vacations, or play is a surefire way to burn out, fuel depression, and create emptiness.

Many medical and mental health issues may cause feelings of emptiness – mood disorders, borderline personality disorder, eating disorders, body dysmorphia, schizophrenia – and physical illnesses that affect our minds and bodies.

If it doesn’t seem like there is generally anything off in your life and you’re feeling empty, it would be a good idea to consult with a doctor about the problem. The emptiness could be a symptom of a physical illness rather than a mental illness.

As we’ve discussed in this article, many of the problems that cause emptiness will likely be longer projects that need some kind of professional help. That’s helpful information for making long-term life changes. However, that isn’t necessarily as helpful when you’re mired in those feelings at the moment.

Let’s look at some ways to get through those low times until you can get the professional help you might need.

You may be able to find support with your friends and loved ones while you’re experiencing this low.

However, not everyone is fortunate enough to have people like that in their life. You may also find support through online sources like social media groups or even an online therapist to provide some temporary support.

It’s tempting to want to fold in on oneself when feeling empty, but try not to. Force yourself to reach out as much as you can to people that you know you can trust.

It’s a good idea to make this kind of arrangement ahead of time with a particular friend or supporter, though. Ask them if they are willing to give you some support in your low times, so they know when things are serious. It’s a better option than shooting out messages and hearing back from no one.

Journaling is a powerful tool when wielded correctly. It may help to write about the events of the day, what happened to evoke emptiness, and explore the event’s feelings.

Emptiness can also be a sign of trying to suppress emotions, which is necessary sometimes to get through the day. After all, you can’t spend your day crying at work, really.

What you can do is come back and revisit those emotions later when you have time for yourself and some privacy.

There are many unkind messages to “suck it up” and get through it, which is sometimes necessary. What that kind of mentality neglects to mention is that you can go back and explore those feelings later.

Most people who do shut down their emotions to cope don’t go back and explore later. That gives those emotions time to compound into more significant issues that create and maintain emptiness.

Do you have goals? If not, you should set some short and long-term goals. Knowing that you have things that you’re working toward can help kick start emotional processes surrounding those goals.

Being able to push through with a burst of hope or acknowledgment of past accomplishments may be enough to spark a light through the emptiness for a little bit.

Do keep records or journal about your goals, how you want to reach them, and what you hope to get out of them. It’ll be helpful to look back through to see how far you’ve come when you’re experiencing a difficult time.

Depression, emptiness, and the negative feelings surrounding these things can strangle our enjoyment of the activities we love most.

Even if you can’t enjoy them at the moment, it may be helpful to engage in them anyway.It’s an opportunity to reconnect with happiness and joy you won’t have if you zone out into mindless or unfulfilling activities.

Do these things in moderation and with consideration. Try to think of what makes you happy about the activity.

Try to avoid activities that you can too easily zone out into, like binge-watching your favorite show. That can too quickly turn into a mindless activity that fuels the emptiness instead of combats it.

Do seek out professional help if you are experiencing persistent feelings of emptiness. They are not normal, and they are not a healthy way to experience your life.

The longer it goes on, the harder it is to deal with and heal from. If you’re struggling or can’t seem to find a solution on your own, there is no shame in reaching out to a professional for help.

Still not sure why you feel so empty inside or what to do about it? Speak to a therapist today who can walk you through the process. Simplyconnect with one of the experienced therapists on BetterHelp.com.

Imagine feeling blah, but on steroids. Or unmotivated, but bigly. Feeling like nothing is enjoyable (and that nothing matters anyway) is a serious symptom calledanhedonia. Here’s a quick primer on what it is, plus two science-backed ways to beat the capital-B blahs.

Ugh.

I don’t feel like it.

Everything is terrible.

What’s the point?

Sound like your inner monologue right now?

If you haven’t been enjoying (insert activity that used to bring you joy), you have nomotivationto see friends or get going, or you’re feeling generally ground down by the world, know that what you’re experiencing has a name: anhedonia.

Unlike hedonism (the concept, not the clothing-optional resort in Jamaica), which is the pursuit of pleasure and gratification, anhedonia is its opposite. With anhedonia, the brain’s ability to feel joy, satisfaction, or enjoyment gets put on mute. It feels like nothing really matters anymore. In other words, anhedonia feels like the moment in "The Wizard of Oz"when Dorothy steps from her black-and-white world into Technicolor, except in reverse.

What’s at the root of anhedonia? It can be a part ofburnout,PTSD,substance abuse, schizophrenia, or even Parkinson’s disease, but the granddaddy of anhedonia isdepression.A study inThe American Journal of Psychiatryfound that 95 percent of people with major depression reported a loss of interest or pleasure—a virtual vaporization of joy from their lives.

Notice that the study used two particular words:interestandpleasure. Those two concepts are actually quite different and illustrate how anhedonia packs a one-two punch.

How? It turns out there are two types of enjoyment:anticipatory, also known as “wanting,” andconsummatory, also known as “liking.” Think of the difference between looking forward to a vacation and actually being on vacation. There’s the excitement of planning and imagining in your mind’s eye what you’ll do and how you’ll feel. But then there’s also the pleasure of the moment—how you feel when you’re finally on the beach with your mojito, riding up the ski lift, or hiking down the trail in search of a blissful lack of cellphone coverage.

But in anhedonia, both wanting and liking are muted. Without “wanting,” you may not look forward to things or you may feel unmotivated. You can’t see the reward or pleasure at the end of the road, so why bother slogging down it in the first place?

Without “liking,” you may take no joy in things you usually love. It’s when a superfan doesn’t care if his team wins, the social butterfly withdraws from her friends, or the avid gardener lets his roses go to seed. Things we usually love—even food orsex—become one big “meh.”

So even if you try and you try, but you can’t get no satisfaction, what should you do? Anhedonia is tough to beat, but it can be done. Here are two research-backed ways to lift the fog.

Practice #1: Do what you usually enjoy and value, even if you’re not in the mood.

The way out of anhedonia is, counterintuitively, through the back door. Don’t wait until you feel better to do the things you love. Instead, do what you used to love, even if you don’t feel like it.

This is hard. It’s easy to get pulled down the swirling drain of inactivity and apathy because your brain and body get understimulated. Breaking the cycle takes a lot of effort, especially if you’ve felt depressed for a long time.

Luckily, doing what you used to love can be accomplished on many scales. Start with a small thing that takes two minutes, like blasting your favorite song, rubbing your dog’s tummy, or making homemade hot chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream. And sprinkles. Mmm... sprinkles. I digress: Whatever it is doesn’t have to be big. It may feel like just a drop, but drop by drop, you can fill an ocean.

Next, if you can’t bring yourself to be around people just yet, that’s fine. Stay in and do the things you love: make brownies, do some online yoga, work on your guitar riffs, or watch a comedy special (but don’t over-rely on thescreen time). The point is to deliberately do things you enjoy and are in line with your values.

Eventually, schedule things that get you out of the house, even if you don’t see the point. Accept your friends’ invitation to meet at the grilled cheese food truck, go for a hike, or, as in one of my favorite client stories, sign up for the Mr. Leather contest at the corner gay bar, and to your surprise, win.

Psychologists call thisbehavioral activation, and if it sounds like fake it ‘til you make it, you’re right. It may feel fake, fleeting, or hopeless at first, but the reason it works is that it sets up a positive feedback loop. Your brain affects your behavior, but behavior also affects your brain. So do the things you love, even if you don’t feel the effects right away. Like the Velveteen Rabbit, it’s fake until it becomes real.

A big asterisk: Don’t use this technique to be productive, get stuff done, or motivate yourself to do stuff you hate. The only goals in behavioral activation are meaning andhappiness. So don’t use it to do your laundry or finally get to the post office.

Now, here’s a challenge: What if you’ve been depressed for so long that you can’t remember what you like to do? Think back tochildhood. What did you love then? Do it again. If you loved riding your bike, plonk a helmet on your head and go for a spin around the neighborhood (or for the grownup version, sign up for a spin class). Bonus points if you get ice cream afterward. Did you love to draw? Take an online art class or sit on your stoop with your sketchbook.

Do these things even if it feels like you’re just going through the motions. It won’t feel the same as when you’re healthy, but it will likely feel better than doing nothing at all. If nothing else, getting out of the house will keep you from sliding further into the depths.

The takeaway? Don’t leave these actions to chance. Intentionally set aside time to do the activities you love and value, even if the forces of gravity get really strong right around your couch when it’s time to put on your shoes. There will be a million reasons not to go, but do your best not to listen to them.

Practice #2: Savor the good stuff.

Another practice to push back against anhedonia is calledsavoring. To savor, hold a metaphorical magnifying glass up to your hot chocolate, your hike, or your guitar riffs. Savor these small pleasures, instead of getting distracted by your phone, the news, or your thoughts.

Anhedonia tells you to discount these small moments of joy, to write them off as “just little things,” or to say, “Well, I didn’t feel better, so that was a waste of time.” Instead, notice with as many of your five senses as possible what you just did, even if you have to peer really closely to find any enjoyment. Lean into the smell of freshly brewed coffee, the beat of your favorite song, or the warm and fuzzy energy of your dog.

In addition to payingattentionwith your senses, zoom in on any sense of pride, joy, or accomplishment you may feel. It will likely be small or fleeting, but pay close attention and revel in it to make it last.

And don’t stop with savoring the moment. In addition, you can bring to mind recent pleasures. Each evening, take the time to note three things you enjoyed that day. Actually write them down, in a journal or the notes section of your phone. That way, you’ll create a growing list of things—those drops that make up the ocean—that emphasize and reinforce pleasure, mastery, and joy.

In summary, do what you used to love, on a daily basis (at minimum!),beforeyou feel like it. Tune into the experience using your five senses, and bask in it, even if it doesn’t seem like much. Eventually, you’ll find yourself stepping out the door and back into a world of Technicolor.

Transcript:
(00:01) good morning Dwayne here Dry Creek Wrangler School we got a morning here we got a new class coming in next to the last class for this year being this afternoon so Mom and I are taking the chance and taking the opportunity to make another video this morning I've been chewing on this we didn't make a video for a couple of weeks and then I just posted two videos they were both horse related and this topic I've been chewing on for a little while but I've been hesitant to put it up because I didn't really have things
(00:38) clear in my mind um but I'm going to take a chance this morning and see what we come up with the for the last many weeks I've gotten a lot of contacts comments on the channel um emails different things about young men especially I mean it's it's pandemic around the world I think but young men especially in this country who are just feeling isolated and alone uh it's it's a really bad situation in this country Mama sent me a a video link of a guy and he was talking about in this country the numbers of uh when it comes to
(01:29) suicides when it comes to uh homelessness when it comes to prisons the numbers of men in these situations are astronomically higher uh than women and then this same guy read a lot of the feedback from women and it was it was horrible they were celebrating the fact that men are three times three times more likely to commit suicide um I just can't and it's no wonder good men in this world are backing away from women and saying look this is just this is not this is not right and uh and when this attitude pervades
(02:15) when this attitude pervades feminists cannot sit there and say we're only about equality let me let me give you a thought ladies I'm going to get a lot of I'm going to get a lot of grief for this and I don't care I don't know you and I ain't scared of you okay if a man is here and you want to be equal and the only way you can get equal is to band together and tear him down so that you can be at this level you're not equal you're not equal okay you're a parasite I'm not gonna go any further into that
(02:59) all right because I'll get I will get wound up and get scratchy men you're feeling isolating alone and lonely what do you do you can't find a good woman these days it seems like and they're out there let me tell you right now there's there's good women are still out there they come through here we meet them around and there are still really good solid women of values who value themselves who value the men around them um they're just harder to find so what's a guy to do look I'm not a I'm not a psychologist
(03:41) I'm not trained I don't okay I'm just I don't know Uncle Dwayne you go sit down and have a cup of coffee and a cigar and say hey man I don't know what to do all I can do is give you my view maybe to help maybe it won't speaking of cigar Perdomo in menso 70. it's the only prodomal cigar um I've ever purchased that disappointed me um I bought a box of them I really like the 70 gauge um sitting around in the evening it gives me a lot of time but this cigar has been the least pleasing of any predominal cigar I've
(04:24) ever had it's not that I don't like it if I didn't like it I wouldn't be wouldn't be having one this morning but it just to me it doesn't measure up it's a Maduro made in Nicaragua everything should be uh and it's from a great company everything should be but this is like I'm down to three out of the box and I have not yet had what I call a mustache burner one that's so good I don't want to let it go and it gets all the way down to the point I'm afraid it's going
(04:51) to burn my mustache and great cigar is a mustache but but it's you know it's pretty decent and I do like the size but I mean I'm getting a hot spot right here back away from my burn and they're just I don't know uh but it's still a it's better than some other cigars but I wanted one this morning just because of the size um so let's look at it guys loneliness loneliness and what is the answer to loneliness well if you're lonely I mean it stands the reason that you're not finding people
(05:28) outside people that you can connect with on a physical level an emotional level oh a mental level a spiritual level whatever wherever you're at now it's harder for some people and I understand personalities I I understand there's difficulty in this like for me I'm very comfortable in my own head I'm very comfortable alone for hours at a time for days at a time um I uh it doesn't mean I haven't felt loneliness it doesn't mean that I don't feel lonely at times but it's not acute
(06:08) it's not something I can't I can't deal with um and to me from what I see is the one companion let's let's think this through the one companion outside of of God if you're follow God if you believe in God and you have him then there's always a friend that sticketh closer to a brother but this we're talking about the human issue the one companion that's always going to be with you is yourself and I think the first thing you have to do I think the first thing we have to do is we have to get ourselves to the point
(06:52) where we don't necessarily need a companion now um it you know in when God created in the Bible when God created Adam and then he looked down he looked it at him he said it's not good that man be alone that's why he created Eve it's not ideal it's not ideal but it's doable and sometimes it beats the alternative uh and ladies the exact same thing uh it's better to be by yourself than it is to be with a bad man uh and but sometimes we choose we choose less than ideal companions because to us that beats the alternative
(07:37) of not having any companion and the reason why we um cannot gr we cannot face the concept of not having any companion is because we're not comfortable with ourself as a companion um we don't want to be left alone by ourselves with ourself so we come in and we sit down and we get on our phone or we turn on the TV or or we go wherever we do whatever because we don't want to face the reality of being by ourself with ourself and so fellas I would say one of the things I would recommend that you think about chew on look into is start making
(08:23) yourself a companion that you're comfortable with now that sounds kind of maybe not real mainstream but if you had a if you had a friend if you had a person you're gonna sit down spend all the time with what would you want from that person what would you want well I would want to spend time with somebody who's honest makes sense I don't want to spend time with somebody who's going to be lying to me all the time someone who's going to gently tell me the truth about myself one of the hardest things sometimes for
(09:07) the human to do is get to the point where they stop lying to themselves where they tell themselves the truth they speak the truth to themselves now you got to face the reality of Who You Are you got to face the reality of what you are all right and and nobody's going to tell you that like you yourself will tell you that um you want to tell yourself the truth but you want to tell yourself the truth in understanding and forgiveness I look back at things in my life and I can't say it was somebody else's fault
(09:51) I can't say I didn't do that I can't say this is why I did that so that made it all right I mean all the way back you know human our entire lives so I got to tell myself the truth yeah that was that was not okay but then I at the same time I have to tell myself that uh you're a human and you made it right and you're making it right and it's okay it's okay wherever you've been in the past that's bad if you're not still there your companion which is yourself needs to feel free to tell you it's okay that
(10:40) was a bad place to be that was a bad person to be but you're not that person anymore and you're not in that place anymore but if you're with yourself and yourself is always beating you up you're not going to want to be with yourself if I'm sitting out here by myself in the evening buy a fire a cup of coffee and a cigar and I'm constantly beating myself up over my failures in the past I'm not someone that I want to be alone with does it make sense all right you got to make yourself and then the
(11:21) next thing I want I would want from a companion is I would want someone who is encouraging who sees the possibility in the future who gently pushes me and encourages me to get out of the rut to get out of the hole to get out of the Sheepfold to get out of the swamp that I'm in and to move on and do better you want someone who's going to encourage you well if you don't have somebody who's going to do that become that somebody and again now I'm fellas I'm I'm blessed I mean I've got mama okay I'm not
(11:56) speaking um I've got something a lot of you guys don't I have mama but at the same time I have a a very comfortable relationship with myself all right and sometimes if you don't have someone like Mama yourself is what you have and you need to encourage yourself you need to look around and you need to be able to encourage yourself and say look I'm not stuck here unless I choose to stay here I get people get on the Channel all the time and they're like Dwayne you're out of touch you don't know what you're
(12:33) talking about you're out in the country those of us in the city we don't have that opportunity well now I've been in a lot of cities and I've never been in a city that had a big wall around it that wouldn't let you out if you actually want to leave you actually want to get away from the crime from the the homelessness from the situations that are being bred in the cities today leave now sometimes you can't I'm not totally stupid sometimes you can't um and but a lot of you a lot more of
(13:18) you can than can't now it takes courage it takes courage it takes sacrifice I mean I read if I was single and in some of these cities and I read what's going on in these cities and I read about the politics and and the crime and the homelessness and the the um cost of living and and the cost of rent and the cost of groceries and and the inability to do all this stuff I'd sell everything I could sell put enough in the backpack and I'd walk out I'd sell my car I'd sell everything don't tell me it can't be done watch the
(13:55) video on there I hitchhiked and took a bus from Tennessee to Cody Wyoming and picked up cigarette butts in the campground for soup and a sandwich and a place to stay until I finally got a job now that job was 350 a month but it included a room in a bunk house and it got me started don't tell me it can't be done it takes guts and you need to have a companion you need to be a companion that's going to gently encourage you and give you the courage to take that next step and to do better and to be better
(14:36) I know guys I know that the how do I the physical aspects of a relationship I know that they're positive I know that they are are things that is hardwired in us to search for but it's not something we gotta have it's not something we have to have and the hell that you go through with these relationships just in order to have someone to sleep with from time to time is not worth a destruction that is doing to your soul and your spirit to your life it's not worth it become your own man become your own man if these feminazis
(15:32) want to burn their own world down around them let them do it you don't have to be in it you don't need their world and you don't need them you don't need them I was asking Deanna this morning I was reading this stuff and I'm like if these women have their way are they going to get out and asphalt these highways are they going to get up on these high lines and do this is I'm not saying they can't but I'm saying the dang sure won't are they going to do sewer lines are they going to go into burning
(16:09) buildings and haul people over their shoulder down off the ladders here and there scattered here and there there's one but women as a whole are not going to do this and that's fine that's their business they can live their life as they want I'm not here bashing women but I am I am totally fed up with this whole feminazi movement that is destroying the young men in this country and nobody can destroy you if you won't let them all right don't let them you're a man you are a man stand up and be a man make the hard
(16:44) decisions make the sacrifices make the unpopular decisions and become comfortable in your own skin and if you are not a person that you are comfortable being alone with that is the one person in this universe that you have full power full right and full responsibility to change okay I don't have the right I don't have the desire to and I do not have the right to try to change my wife's personality and who she is I don't have the right to change anybody except myself now there's people out there I don't
(17:25) like and if I don't like them I just walk away I'm 55 years old I've done without that person my whole dang life I don't need them now and I don't have the right or the desire to try to change them but if I don't like me if I don't like me if I'm not comfortable being with me well that's a different story all right so it doesn't provide all the answers probably doesn't provide any answers I don't know but mailers a little bit of encouragement there maybe somebody
(17:55) there's a little seed a little step a little something that you can say hey you know what I think that helped me and listen just be strong stay strong and ladies I'm not bashing women but I am bashing this this this Godless hateful movement that is destroying this country and destroying the men in this country okay um it's it's not and fellas just don't let me add one more thing here all right I'm choosing my words give me a moment it is human nature it is human nature when a pendulum swings too far one way

Transcript:
(00:00) is it about it's gosh why do I always have flies loneliness it's something that everyone experiences from time to time no matter who you are or where you're from but what is loneliness really and how is it different from things like Solitude when you're feeling lonely it can feel like one of the hardest things in the world and I know because I've been there just like everyone else so in today's video not only am I going to break down what loneliness is really all about but of course I'm going to share with you some
(00:34) practical tips to help you manage and move forward if you're going through a season of loneliness so hang in there I've got those tips coming right up by the way if this is your first time here welcome my name is Dr Therese and I help people take steps toward building a life they don't need a vacation from if you're interested in getting tips on how to build a life that you truly love be sure to like And subscribe and click the Bell below to stay in touch with me and of course you can also follow me on
(01:03) Instagram at exploring.therapy I'm on all the other social media platforms as well I'm sure you can find them in the links below and by the way if you haven't heard me say it before thank you so much for all of your support and engagement in this channel it really makes a difference and so thank you from the bottom of my heart it means the world so let's get started and learn more about loneliness and what to do about it what is loneliness and how does it compare to Solitude surprisingly enough loneliness isn't about a lack of
(01:32) people so much as it is about a lack of being seen heard known and understood listen to that again loneliness isn't about a lack of people okay it's not about a lack of party is a lack of social engagements no loneliness at its very core is about not feeling seen heard understood or known enough Solitude is the experience of being in one's own company or not in the presence of others and also surprisingly being in solitude does not always lead to feelings of loneliness in fact you can be in solitude and feel completely at
(02:12) peace feel completely seen known and understood and so Solitude does not necessarily equal loneliness what are the physical mental emotional and health impacts of loneliness as I've said before loneliness is a painful but common part of The Human Experience prolonged loneliness without hope of relief can lead to significant negative impacts on physical mental and emotional health to give you some examples loneliness over an extended amount of time is associated with so many negative things including heart disease a
(02:45) weakened immune system sleep problems anxiety depression and even Suicidal Thoughts research shows that loneliness is associated with premature mortality or an earlier age of death shockingly some research even shows that loneliness can be just as deadly as smoking 15 cigarettes a day what causes feelings of loneliness so as I mentioned we can feel lonely when we feel a lack of being seen heard understood or known ironically many people experience during lockdown that even though they were in constant meetings and on Zoom calls and in
(03:23) communication with a lot of people they were feeling lonely and the reason for that is that you can have lots of Face Time lots of meetings without actually having the opportunity to feel seen heard and known on a deeper level spending more time on social media ironically can actually lead to more feelings of loneliness because when you're scrolling onto social media you're more likely to get feelings of fomo or fear of missing out you develop the impression that everybody's out there having an amazing time except for
(03:54) you that you're the only one alone you're the only one that's feeling lonely meanwhile everybody has tons of friends and never feels lonely and we know that's not true because loneliness is part of the human experience but social media skews the picture Jen's ears may be even more likely to feel significant feelings of loneliness and so the question is why one reason may be that gen's ears are actually spending less time in social interactions therefore leading to less feelings of social competence and more anxiety in
(04:26) social situations and the other reason is what I was alluding to earlier social media so there's an increase in screen time but there's not necessarily an increase in time getting to build deep meaningful connections where a person can feel seen and known not only does social media time lead to more more feelings of fomo or fear of missing out but also it can lead to increased feelings of insecurity because you're having all of these unrealistic expectations between yourself and what you're seeing on the screen the classic
(04:57) example is someone comparing their body to that of an Instagram model completely unrealistic but when you're looking at that content all day long it's hard not to compare so I want to pause here for a second what about you have you ever felt that being on social media more made you feel more lonely or have you ever been in a room that was filled with people and you felt lonely anyway if so share with us in the comments below we'd love to hear what your experience has been what are some ways to overcome feelings
(05:27) of loneliness managing feelings of loneliness can be challenging because every individual experiences loneliness differently and for different reasons one of the best ways to take a step forward in terms of reducing feelings of loneliness is to practice being vulnerable with other people the good news is this doesn't have to be difficult you can start by doing something that you love alongside other people this could be dancing painting or even video games just make sure that there's actually a chance to connect
(05:59) with people outside of the activity for example going out to coffee with people after the event or exchanging information and making plans to hang out socially another time and hopefully doing something that you love alongside other people who also happen to like it shouldn't be too hard for you and while you're having fun doing something that you enjoy alongside other people who enjoy it too over time you may find that you feel more connected to some people in the group or you may find that some people are easier to trust or feel safe
(06:31) with and those would be perfect people to try sharing some of your more vulnerable messy human difficult experiences with so it's not just about sharing what's perfect and great in your life a la social media it's about actually finding people you feel safe with to share the 360 of your life The Good the Bad and the Ugly another easier way to manage loneliness is to be of service to others and you can have fun with this too so you can volunteer for a cause that you care about like a beach cleanup or volunteering at an animal
(07:07) shelter or a soup kitchen and another thing that I don't think should be overlooked when it comes to managing feelings of loneliness is just going to a support group there are tons of support groups that you can find through a simple Google search and it's people that are dealing with all sorts of normal everyday issues and they want to do it in the presence and with the support of others and so there are support groups for mental health based things anxiety and depression and things of that nature there are support groups for
(07:39) certain experiences in Life or certain stages of life there's a lot of different options available and the point is that you're going through your life together alongside other people so I love support groups because I just think a lot of healing can happen in the group context are there ways to prevent loneliness unfortunately no there aren't really ways to prevent loneliness all the time there are things that we can do to minimize loneliness and it means that we are making a consistent and intentional effort towards putting
(08:13) ourselves in places where where we can be seen heard known and understood but it does take intentionality and it does take effort and most of the time what I find is that people tend to kind of over time get comfortable and forget to put themselves in that position to be seen heard known and understood and so it may require a bit of a reminder and it may require you to again go outside of your comfort zone to find environments where you can experience that again when should you seek professional help for loneliness well I'm going to tell you
(08:49) this most people wait way too long until the problem is way too bad before getting help and support so that's like the equivalent of going to the emergency room when you've had a heart attack instead of doing kind of of the regular maintenance and daily exercise and all the things that you can do to take care of your health and well-being before it becomes a huge problem so what's more effective than of course going to the emergency room to manage our health is to do all that preventative care and go
(09:19) get regular checkups and you can do the same when it comes to loneliness and your mental health in fact making the choice to see a therapist when things aren't severely bad can be a great tool a great instrument to help you maximize your life and to feel the best that you possibly can so like going to the doctor for regular checkups is great preventative care for your overall health going to therapy can be great preventative care for your heart and mind loneliness isn't easy but it is manageable and I hope today's video
(09:53) helped you have a few tips to give you some hope that there are things that you can do when you're feeling lonely one thing that I want to share with you is that I have a free offering and it's all about boundaries boundaries are an excellent tool at any stage when we're trying to work on our mental health and well-being because boundaries teach us how what to say yes to and what to say no to so if you're interested in the book that I've written on boundaries you can get a copy for free by clicking on

Loneliness is a common feeling, but there are steps you can take to help feel more connected. Listening to music, calling a friend, taking a walk outside, and other activities may reduce your sense of isolation.

Lonelinessis going around, and it’s having a pretty big impact.

Even before psychological distress and lonelinessincreasedduring the COVID-19 pandemic, aJanuary 2020 surveyreported that over three in five Americans felt lonely.

Prolonged loneliness can drain you emotionally, making life seem bleak and pointless. It can also lead to physical symptoms, including aches and pains, sleep problems, and a weakened immune response.

Note that loneliness isn’t the same thing as social isolation. You can be alone without feeling lonely. You can also feel lonely even when you’re around other people. Loneliness happens when you feel distressed when you’re alone, while social isolation is the lack of regular interactions with other people.

When it feels impossible to escape feelings of loneliness, these 13 tips can help you navigate them and keep them from wearing you down.

Casting a different light on what it means to be alone may make it easier to navigate feelings of loneliness.

Loneliness happens when yourneedsfor social interaction and human connection go unmet. Different people have different interaction needs, so this doesn’t happen at the same point for everyone. For example:

Most people needclose relationshipsin order to thrive. That said,researchsuggests that some amount of solitude — or quality alone time — is also important. Solitude creates opportunities forself-discovery, creative thought, and self-reflection.

Time alonecan also open the door to greater mindfulness, which may help reduce anxiety and depression.

Next time loneliness begins to surface, accept it as it comes. Maybe you put on music and pick up a forgotten sketchpad, flip through old notebooks and rediscover your love of poetry, or simply sit and get in tune with your feelings and personal goals.

Whatever you choose to do, finding ways to make the most of your alone time can help you lean into solitude and use it to your benefit.

It may feel difficult to notice positive things in your life when you feel lonely, but taking a few minutes to practice gratitude each day may help you feel better.

Practicing gratitude can be as simple as thinking of something small you enjoyed recently, like talking to a friend or eating a tasty meal. You can also try to:

A2019 studyfound that participating in a daily gratitude writing exercise reduced loneliness and improved health among older adults.

Music and other sounds aren’t specifically proven to reduce loneliness, but they may still help push it back.

Sound may help fill the space in your environment and thoughts, which can make it feel less overwhelming. For example:

Even if you don’t see all yourfriendsor family regularly, you can still maintain your closeness.Research from 2021suggests that virtual interactions, especially when you’re connecting to a larger number of people, may help reduce loneliness and benefit mental health if you can’t meet others in person.

Sometimes a quick text can seem like the easiest way to connect, but don’t underestimate the power of speaking to another person. A2021 studyfound that even a regular 10-minute phone call may help ease loneliness.

Simply spending time around others won’t always relieve loneliness. A2021 studyfound that being in overcrowded areas actually increased feelings of loneliness.

The quality of your interactions often matters more than the number. That’s why you might feel lonely in a large group of casual acquaintances but fulfilled by a quiet evening with your closest friend.

How you spend time with others can make a big difference, too. Sometimes, you might just need some company and feel fine watching a movie with a friend or sharing space while working or browsing social media.

When you feel the need to connect on a deeper level, try to find ways to make your interactions more meaningful:

It’s hard to entirely avoid talking about current events, and you might want to stay informed about what’s happening in the world. Even so, it may help to center your conversations around things that bring you both joy rather than dwelling entirely on distressing news.

A change of environment can distract you and help dull the ache of loneliness. Getting out of the house can put you in the path of others and remind you that you aren’t alone in the world.

Time in naturecan also help ease emotional distress and boost your overall wellness.

A few ideas to try:

Getting out on foot (or bike) can also tire you out, making for good sleep.

Aresearch review from 2020suggests that loneliness may be linked to worse sleep quality and insomnia, but the effects don’t stop there. Sleeping poorly can affect daytime functioning, which might, in turn, increase your sense of isolation.

Emotionstend to gather under the surface and intensify when theygo unacknowledged. Expressing your feelings out loud, however, may diminish their power to cause distress.

Telling a loved one you feel lonely can make it easier to get importantemotional supportthat helps loosen the grip of loneliness.

Talking about difficult emotionscan also help empower your loved ones to share any feelings they might be struggling with, making it possible to explorecoping strategiestogether.

Sharing painful orunwanted emotionswith others can feel difficult, especially if you aren’t used to talking about your feelings. If you’re not feeling up to it, journaling offers another way to express and sort through feelings privately that,researchshows, can promote well-being.

Creative pursuits like art, music, and writing can helpimprove mental health. If these activities bring you joy and help you feel more connected, they may also help reduce feelings of loneliness.

Creation can also leave you with a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction, emotions that might challenge a prevailing mood of loneliness and sadness.

Another key benefit of creativity lies in reaching a flow state. Flow, often as a sense of being “in the zone,” can happen anytime you challenge yourself with an activity you’re passionate about.

Finding your flow means reaching a point where distracting sensations and emotions (like loneliness) temporarily fade away, allowing you to fully focus on your art, music, or anything else.

A2020 studyduring COVID-19 lockdowns in China found that participants who reported reaching flow also experienced more positive emotions and less loneliness.

While a fresh canvas or blank page may not completely erase loneliness or keep it from coming back, art offers another area of focus, one where you can harness your emotions to create something permanent and moving.

Animals may not be able to talk (unless, of course, you have a vocal bird), but they provide companionship all the same. The presence of another living creature can comfort you, and their antics can help lift your spirits andrelieve stress, as thousands of pet videos on the internet can confirm.

Researchalso suggests pet ownership can improve both mental and physical wellness. As another bonus, having a dog gives you a reason to head outside on a regular basis.

If you don’t have a pet of your own, consider looking into volunteer opportunities at local shelters. This may have a dual benefit, asresearchindicates that spending time volunteering may reduce loneliness.

If you love dogs but can’t have one, consider visiting your local dog park. If anyone asks why you’re there, just explain that you love dogs but don’t have one of your own. Everyone there is likely already a dog lover, so chances are they’ll understand (and maybe even let you toss a ball to their dog).

While social media often seems like an appealing way to maintain connections with loved ones, it can sometimesincrease feelings of loneliness.

A loved one’s happy, carefree post can give the impression they don’t miss you quite as much as you miss them. When you’re alone, seeing others spending time with romantic partners or family members can also sting.

Of course, social media never shows the whole picture, so you can’t really know what your loved ones feel without asking. It’s also worth considering some of those posts might serve as someone else’s approach to countering loneliness.

Researchalso suggests that comparing yourself to others on social media may be linked to increased loneliness.

In short, it never hurts to close those apps and connect with a phone call or text instead.

Loneliness can occupy your thoughts to the point where it feels difficult to think about anything else, including the things you usually enjoy.

Still, favorite hobbies canfill the timeuntil you’re able to see loved ones again. Doing things you enjoy or that are meaningful to you — from yoga to video games to baking — may also ground you and help you find inner calm.

Don’t forget that hobbies andrelaxing activitiesalso benefit mental health, according toresearch, which plays an important part in overall well-being.

However overwhelming it feels, loneliness won’t last forever. Acknowledging that fact can sometimes bring some relief. Know also that the feeling iswidespread, so you’re not alone in feeling this way.

Sometimes it can take a little time and effort, but it’s always possible to reach out and strengthen existing connections orforge new ones.

If loneliness leaves you feeling low and hopeless, you might need a listening ear or extra support to get through a moment of crisis.

You can call the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline or text the Crisis Text Line 24/7 to get free, confidential support from a trained counselor. They’ll listen to whatever’s on your mind and help you explore strategies to find some relief.

Here’s how to get in touch in the U.S.:

When waves of loneliness crash over your head, there’s a lot you can do to ride them out.

It’s increasingly common for someone to be diagnosed with a condition such as ADHD or autism as an adult. A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers.

UpdatedJune 1, 2024|Reviewed by Jessica Schrader

The great irony is that as we become increasingly "connected"—onsocial media, video calling, and messaging—we simultaneously feel increasingly lonely. And even though we may use technology to feel more connected, it may be exactly what’sleadingus to feel lonely.

After spending the last year researching and writing my new book,Outsmart Your Smartphone: Conscious Tech Habits for Finding Happiness, Balance, and Connection IRL, I've learned that most of us feel disconnected. What about you? Are you feeling socially connected? (Take thiswell-being quizto see how you're feeling.) If not, try some of these 18 strategies to stop feeling lonely.

1. Practice self-kindness.In difficult moments, it's essential to practice self-kindness. Blaming ourselves when we feel lonely is not helpful. So limit your hurtfulself-talk,take care of yourself, and just generally give yourself a break. Perhaps a walk in nature or a day at the spa may be helpful for getting yourself into a self-kindness mood.

2. Capitalize on the present moment.When you feel good about something, share it with others right away, and I don't mean "share" by posting on your social media. You could share by calling or texting a friend. Or share with the people you work with. Keep in mind that the positive things that you can share don’t have to be big. You could simply have woken up on the right side of the bed and think, “Hey, I’m feeling great today.” By sharing these moments, you create small moments ofsavoringand connection with others that can help you overcomeloneliness.

3. Connect in real life.Connecting in real life may not be as easy as it once was. We often default tousing our smartphones—it's easier, and now it's culturally accepted. But we can decrease our loneliness if we build stronger in-person connections. We do this by looking people in the eyes, listening, beingmindful, and choosing not be distracted by our phones or other technologies.

4. Rethink how you spend your spare time.When we feel lonely, sometimes we just want to retreat into a corner and hide. Other times, our endless to-do list may leave us too exhausted to go out and be social. But opting to stay aloneevery nightwith our phones, watching Netflix, or playing on Facebook can really get us stuck in loneliness. We've created a life for ourselves that deprives of us of meaningful social connection, and the only way to get out of it is to start living differently.

If we instead use our loneliness to motivate us to reach out to people, then we can strengthen our relationships. By opting to cope with our loneliness by seeking out social support, wecreate more social momentswith the people in our lives who matter to us, which usually reduces our loneliness.

5. Do more things with people.Engaging in face-to-face social interactions tends to improve our mood and reducedepression. Activities that involve other people—such as attending religious services or engaging in sports—are also likely to have positive effects on our mental health. So find ways to be around people more.

6. Talk to strangers.A growingbody of research suggeststhat even seemingly trivial interactions with strangers—like chatting with a barista or cashier—may be able to keep loneliness at bay by helping us feel more socially connected. So reach out to other human beings to say hello, ask them how they are, or chat about whatever's on your mind. These small acts can make a big difference and help you reduce feelings ofloneliness.

7. Be active online.Instead of passively surfing the net or your social media, if you want to go online, opt instead to do something that involves the active participation of other people. For example, you could play games with others, chat about something you care about, give advice on a forum, or have a video call with a friend. The more you interact with others while online, the more connected you are likely to feel.

8. Share for real online.Somewhere along the way, the word “sharing” got co-opted on social media to describe what is really just “humble bragging.” We post about cool things we did, nice meals we ate, or a fun party we went to—all things that we didn’t actually share with the people who are viewing our posts.

Instead of posting about things you did, reclaim the word “share” for what it really means—to give a small or large portion of what is yours to someone else. You could share advice, words of support, or even empathy, all from your smartphone. As a result, your connections are likely to be more kind and supportive.

9. Stop focusing so much on you.It's almost inevitable in our modern technology-crazed world that we start to believe we don’t have enough. Bob got a new car. Sherri got a new house. Sonja got a new job. We also see false or unrealistic images—models Photoshopped to have perfect waists and abs—and we feelenvious. As a result, we become increasingly focused on how we are not measuring up.

Instead of focusing on what you can get,shift your focus to what you can give. You could sell T-shirts online to raise money for a good cause. You could ask friends to donate to a charity for your birthday. By giving to others, you take the focus off yourself and do good at the same time, helping you to feel more connected and less lonely.

10. Stop your negative thought cycles.We might repeatedly think about what we could have done differently to prevent ourselves from feeling so alone. We ruminate on the events or people or causes, because we mistakenly believe that thinking about our loneliness over and over again will help us solve it. Unfortunately, it does us no good to get caught up in our thoughts instead of taking the actions we need to feel better.

To put an end to these negative thought cycles, we need to take action—do something different that stops these thoughts and changes our experience of the world. For example, if I'm feeling lonely, I'll go to the gym or schedule lunches with friends for the next few days. And it helps.

11. Generate a sense ofawe.Awe (like when we witness the birth of new baby, or a majestic mountain) makes time seem like it’s standing still and helps us be more open to connecting. Something about feeling small in the context of a big world appears to help us see ourselves as part of a whole, which may help us feel less alone. So expose yourself to something that creates awe—like landscapes, new experiences, or new foods (here's somemindful exercisesto get started).

12. Spend money on experiences.If we're spending all our money on things, we won't have the cash to spend money on experiences with others. And it turns out thatspending money on experiencesis way better for our mental health. So get creative and think about what you want to do with others. For example, I might go on a canoeing trip, go wine tasting, plan a beach party, or host an arts & crafts night. What group activities might make you feel less lonely?

13. Payattentionto the things that matter.How do we expect to improve our loneliness when we don't know what causes it? It's hard. So it's helpful to start paying attention to the present moment. What are the experiences that make you feel lonely? And what are the experiences that make you feel connected or like you belong? Identifying these moments can help you reduce loneliness, because you can limit your engagement in activities that make you feel lonely and increase your engagement in activities that make you feel connected.

14. Create a vision board.I keep a vision board tacked up by my desk to remind me of mygoals. A big chunk of my vision board is about connecting—building community, networking, spending time with family, and the like. Sometimes I have a hard time sticking to it, but having the vision board reminds me to. Once you discover the things that make you feel less lonely and more connected, it can be helpful to create a board or list or plan for what you'll do—something to keep near you so you remember what you need to do to combat loneliness.

15. Tend to your network.Sometimes we can end up feeling alone even though we are connected to lots of people. So it can be helpful to reach out to these people and schedule times to catch up. Aim to schedule at least one social hour per week—a coffee date, lunch, or happy hour. Who knows, maybe an oldfriendshipcan be reignited.

16. Join an online group of like-minded people.You can now find people online with just about any interest — for example,politics, cooking, or sports.Joining one of these mission-oriented groupscan be a way to feel more connected to others, even when you don't have access to face-to-face interactions. You might get to know some new people or make lifelong friends. You can even try out a few groups to see which ones fit you best and decrease your loneliness the most.

17. Volunteer remotely or in real life.For some of us, it's hard to find people to spend time with, let alone connect with. So we have to find new people. One way to do this is by volunteering for a cause, either remotely or in your town. Just be sure you're working with others. Working on an important problem with others can help you decrease loneliness.

18. Be nice to yourself.It’s important to practiceself-compassionwhen you fail at things. Remember, everyone fails, and there is no need to be abullyto yourself, feel guilty, or put yourself down. That kind of attitude won’t help you decrease loneliness, now or in the future. Instead, try talking to yourself in a way that is supportive, kind, and caring—and you’ll be more likely to acknowledge mistakes you may have made in trying to decrease loneliness, and hopefully do better next time.

What To Do If You’re The Toxic One In Your Relationship - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhPW6rzqRo

Transcript:
(00:00) Hi, I'm Dr. Tracey Marks, a psychiatrist, and I make mental health education videos. When I started making videos on YouTube in 2018, one of my early videos was how to recognize a toxic relationship. That video was based on a blog post that I wrote in 2010. I had no idea at the time that toxic people or relationships would be trending topics.
(00:23) At the time I made the video, I was focused on the person on the receiving end of these behaviors, and how they could recognize and deal with them. I didn't expect to get questions from people saying, "What if I'm the toxic one? What do I do?" Since I've gotten that question a lot, I decided to answer it here.
(00:43) First, let me review the behaviors. I'm just going to list them, but for descriptions of them, you can watch the original video that I'll link to this one. Here are the 10 red flags or signs of a toxic relationship. Number one, chronic anger, like blowups or moodiness. Two, chronic sarcasm, which is a form of disguised anger.
(01:05) Three, disparaging humor. Things aren't funny, unless it insults someone. Four, having a punitive mindset that people deserve the bad things that happen to them. Five, needing to control people. Six, excessive insecurity and needing constant reassurance. Seven, being extremely opinionated and judgemental.
(01:30) Eight, manipulating you with guilt. Nine, predominant self-centeredness in a way that they take more than they give. And number 10, needing to be on the offense with the worldview that people will stick it to you, unless you get yours first. That's a lot of negative stuff, but to be clear, these are not meant to be characteristics that define a narcissist.
(01:55) These are thoughts and behavior patterns that anyone can engage in. It could be someone with a personality disorder, like narcissistic borderline or even obsessive compulsive personality disorder, and/or it could be someone who is depressed and bitter. What if you are the one that's doing these things? First off, if you recognize these things in yourself, and own them as causing problems in relationships, you've already made a huge step.
(02:24) Change starts with insight, and some people will hear these things, and get defensive or justify them. For example, the person who's always mad about something may justify their anger as a normal response to being around idiots. So, you've already made progress if you're willing to accept these thoughts and behaviors as problems that start with you as opposed to externalizing blame onto other people or situations.
(02:51) Next, you need to expand your self-awareness. You will need an independent person to help you see your blind spots. The independent person should be a professional, like a therapist. A personality or relationship coach may work as well, depending on their skillset. What kind of therapy would you get? A psychodynamically oriented therapy will have a heavy focus on why you do and think these things.
(03:17) What are the origins of the behavior? Psychodynamic psychotherapy seeks to make your unconscious motivations conscious, so that you can break the pattern, and think or behave differently the next time the situation arises. The therapist does this by asking you questions about your upbringing, and looking at things, like who made you feel supported and loved? Who praised you? Who criticized you and how? Are any of your current relationship dynamics a reenactment of an earlier relationship? This kind of therapy takes time to see change.
(03:52) We're talking weekly therapy for months, if not years. The older you are, the more work it takes to change these kinds of patterns. One thing about this approach is you can spend too much time focused on why, and not as much time focused on changing the behavior. Some people call this getting stuck on blaming mother, for example, you may come to understand that you're quick to judge people negatively, because your father never validated you.
(04:21) Nothing you did was good enough. Okay, got it. But the person you just publicly shamed, because they failed to do what you asked, doesn't care about how your father treated you. They just see you as being unnecessarily hurtful. So you have to pivot from talking about the past, and move toward changing your reactions to people in the present.
(04:42) To do this, you need to be actively engaged with people in relationships, so that you're doing things in real time that you and your therapist can analyze. The relationships can be casual, romantic, or family. With cognitive therapy, instead of exploring things, like why you find joy in insulting people, the focus is on the stories you tell yourself to justify your behavior.
(05:06) If you believe that you need to see other people lose to feel a win for yourself, the cognitive therapist would help break down that thought for a specific situation, and uncover the base thought that promotes that attitude. So let's say the base thought was that someone else's success means there won't be much good fortune left for you.
(05:28) A scarcity mindset kind of thing. So someone getting a raise means that you probably won't get one too. Cognitive therapy would have you ask questions, like "What's the evidence that there's only one opportunity available?" "What's the likelihood that you would've gotten a raise if the other person hadn't gotten one?" You would challenge your assumptions, and find a more reasonable way to think about the situation.
(05:53) Almost any negative behavior or motivation can be traced back to unhelpful, distorted thoughts that you're acting on. Some other therapies for personality disorders are interpersonal therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, which is a type of cognitive behavior therapy, mentalization therapy, and schema therapy.
(06:13) If you have problematic personality traits that are worsened by depression or anxiety, seeking medication treatment for either of these conditions may improve how you relate to people. One person posed the question, "What if my therapist is not a good fit for me? How do I break up with them?" My answer to that is to be upfront and say, "I want to move in a different direction with my therapy.
(06:37) I'd like to try a new therapist." If you're not good with expressing yourself, especially in a conflict situation, memorize that statement and just say it. Your therapist should be trained to handle this kind of directness. That's not to say that he or she is bulletproof, and won't be disappointed.
(06:56) They may have hurt feelings, but they should also be able to handle your request professionally, and likely offer to have one more session with you to wrap up. They should not pass on to you any hurt feelings or resentment about your decision. Why? Because part of the training of a therapist is to expect this to happen from time to time, and help patients process the termination.
(07:20) Take a look at this video for more of an explanation on the signs of a toxic relationship and ways to detox the relationship if you are on the receiving end, and this video on breaking the cycle of repeating the same negative relationship over and over. Thanks for watching. See you next time.

Even the best of relationships run into problems sometimes. You’re both tired from work, or the kids are in trouble at school, or your in-laws are getting on your last nerve…you know how it goes.

Life throws all kinds of challenges at a relationship, from relocation to redundancy to illness. No wonder problems arise in even the strongest relationships.

To keep a relationship running smoothly,it is important tosolve marriage problemsbefore they snowball into bigger relationship problems.

For some, however, that phase of love eventually fades. As time passes and both parties of the relationship make their fair share of mistakes, what was once intoxicating becomes intolerable.

Much of the common relationship issues that couples face are minor and can easily be avoided with mutual effort, understanding and respect. Although bumps along the path of marriage are unavoidable, if you are aware of them beforehand, you will be able to overcome them without leading your relationship to the verge of collapse.

None of us are perfect, nor will we exactly be the same on every level.

Some character flaws, on the other hand, will be natural and acceptable. But if there are behaviors, perhaps a little lie here or an indiscretion there, it’s essential to consider that on a grander scale as the relationship progresses.

Is that an ongoing problem you want to work through continually, or does that constitute a deal-breaker? Something to consider.

What candestroy a relationship? Many of the problems couples come to me for, seem to stem from issues that either cause or intensify their problems. But once couples learn how to address these two issues, everything else seems to start falling into place also.

Check out these causes of common relationship issues or issues behind relationship problems before understanding ways to solve common relationship problems:

One of the fastest ways to create unhappiness and instability in a relationship is through disappointment. And very few things create disappointment as quickly as unmet expectations.

But, there are typically two common relationship problems with expectations in a relationship:

Oftentimes, couples struggle to meet each other’s expectations because they are simply unrealistic. It’s important to understand that our expectations often derive from other people, past experiences, beliefs, or internal values. But, that doesn’t change the fact that they are sometimes very toxic to our relationship.

Alternatively, couples sometimes struggle to meet each other’s expectations because they simply don’t know what the other one expects from them or in their relationship.

Now, maybe you are pretty certain about what YOU expect from your relationship and your partner, but that doesn’t mean that your partner can read your mind, which means they most likely have no clue what you expect.

If you want to avoid unhappiness in your relationship, it is your responsibility to be very clear about your expectations and share those with your partner.

If in doing so, you come to realize that some of your expectations might be slightly unrealistic, or even impossible to meet, you might want to review where that expectation comes from and what is more important – being unrealistic or being happy.

One of the most common relationship issues that couples face is communication. There is often either a complete absence of communication,constant miscommunication, or very poor communication. The end result is almost always frustration, unhappiness, and unmet needs. Many times the root cause of the communication issue is in “interpretation.”

You misunderstand what the other person is saying and spend too much time and energy arguing a point your partner never intended. It’s a futile exercise. It is, therefore, essential to take the time to fully comprehend what your partner is trying to say.

Also, if you’re the one talking, it’s important to make sure you’re communicating clearly and exactly what you mean so that your partner can understand. You need to recognize the fact that their perspective is not the same as yours.

Their experiences, points of view, and even baggage are not the same as yours. But good communication demands empathy. It’s to see the world through their eyes as much as possible and then treat them the way that you would treat yourself.

Another common relationship problem occurs when a partner is unsupportive of goals and interests. When you are in a relationship, you want to treat your partner like they can be whatever they want to be.

You want them to follow their dreams and will do anything you can to help support them along the way – and you expect the same in return!

One of the most common relationship problems couples will admit to are troubles in the relationship with finances. Not having enough money or not knowinghow to split your financial burdens, as well as loss of jobs, a lack of money, poor money management, debt, and overspending are all common issues that can put pressure on relationships.

Discuss your finances when your relationship gets serious, and be honest about any debt you may have. Rely on one another if money gets tight and never stop communicating.

Cheating is a huge issue in relationships today. The internet has made all forms of cheating as simple as downloading an app. Sexting,emotional affairs, porn, sneaking around, and physical relationships with someone other than your romantic partner are all huge issues that damage relationships, sometimes irreversibly.

Infidelity is a hard subject to broach with your romantic partner, but it is in the best interest of your relationship to let your partner know when you are emotionally or physically checking out. You owe it to yourself to give your relationship another shot. Get your issues out in the open either with date nights or regular honest communication or seek couples counseling to help mend your relationship.

Some of the common relationship problems involve not spending enough time alone together. This is especially true for couples who have children. Between work and family obligations, you sometimes feel morelike roommates than romantic partners. This is because you have stopped ‘dating’ one another. Such circumstances can make a romantic partner feel unappreciated, unattractive, and emotionally frustrated.

Call up your favorite babysitter and establish a child-free date night once a week with your spouse. This allows you to reconnect as a couple instead of as parents. Go on dates and treat one another like you’re still trying to woo each other.

Boredom is a common problem in long-term relationships. Being with the same person for many years can seem to take the ‘spark’ out of your union. You may also feel you have outgrown one another. Don’t despair or give up.

You can reverse this feeling by looking for new ways to connect with your partner. Look for new things to do together such as travel or take up a hobby. This will help you bond over something fun and exciting.

As the years go by and your relationship becomes seasoned, there will likely be a point where your sexual flame will dim. There could be a multitude of reasons as to why you or your partners in sex has dwindled, but no matter what the cause is, this decrease insexual intimacytends to cause common relationship issues.

In order to avoid such problems, there are a few important things that you should consider:

But after 10, 20, or 30 times seeing the same plotline play out, you only pulled it out for special occasions. Your sex life is just like that favorite movie. So,spice things up. Your favorite movie’s plotline is set in stone. The plotline between you and your spouse’s sexual experience can be changed any time you want it to.

Get creative, get ambitious, and understand that it’s not the other person’s fault. It’s just that, although you enjoy having sex, it’s just the same thing over and over again. Try something new today.

The anger habit soon gets ingrained, and before you know it, you’re spending a large chunk of time fighting with your partner.

Think about it – if someone is angry and shouting at you, how likely are you to listen carefully and look for a solution?

Most people, understandably, react to anger with either anger or fear.

Let your partner know that they are a priority to you by consulting them before you make decisions.

Big decisions like whether to take a new job or move to a new city are obvious life choices that should be discussed with your spouse.

But don’t forget to include them in smaller decisions such as who picks up the kids tonight, making plans with friends for the weekend, or whether you eat dinner together or grab something for yourself.

All relationships have their highs and lows, even the happiest of ones. There is no escaping them, and if not dealt with accurately, they can lead your relationships towards absolute chaos and destruction.

Here are 10 signs your relationship is having problems:

Now, how to solve relationship issues?

Common relationship issues are not hard to solve; all you need for that is a strong will to work on your relationship issues, andlove, of course.

Here are some common marriage problems and the solutions for how to resolve your relationship problems that you should know about.

When wondering about how to solve relationship problems, it can be useful to read first and then bring the conversation up about how to handle relationship problems with your partner.

Lack of trust is a major problem in any relationship.

Lack of trust isn’t always related toinfidelity– it can rear its head any time. If you find yourself constantly doubting your partner or wondering if they’re truthful with you, it’s time totackle your trust issues together.

Relationship problems will keep mushrooming when there is a dearth of trust in a relationship.

Solution:

Be consistent and trustworthy. Each of you should make an effort to be where you say you’re going to be and do what you say you’re going to do. This is one of the best solutions to marriage problems.

Call when you say you’ll call. Never lie to your partner. Showing empathy and respect for your partner’s feelings also helps to build trust.

When life gets too much, you get overwhelmed. Maybe you’re in the midst of going after a promotion at work. Maybe they’re dealing with a troubled teenage son or daughter.

Whatever the reason, your relationship soon takes a back seat. Then relationship problems keep building up.

Solution:

Talk to each other about what’s happening, and about what kind ofsupport each of you needs.Lean on each other instead of getting so caught up in other issues that they drive a wedge between you.

Figure out together a timethat will be just for you two.

Poor communicationleads to misunderstandings, fights, and frustration. It also leads to one or both of you feeling unheard and invalidated and can quickly build into resentment and other common relationship issues.

Solution:

Communication is a skill like any other, and learning it can make all the difference to your relationship. Learn how to listen without judging or interrupting, and how to get your point across without attacking.

Communicate with each other as friends, not combatants.Figure out what your communication style is and how compatible it is with your partner.

Work your way towards the solution by understanding what communication style would work better for both of you.

Also watch:

It’s so easy totake your partner for granted,especially when you have a lot of things going on. Before you know it, the only time you get together is over a hurriedfamilydinner or while trying to get out the door in the morning.

Solution:

Make time for each other every single day. No matter how busy you are, carve out fifteen or thirty minutes; that’s just for the two of you to talk and spend quiet time together.

Text regularly throughout the day. Add in a weekly date night to make sure your partner knows they’re your priority.

Money is a leading cause of stress in relationships.  Maybe there’s not enough. Or maybe there is enough, but they spend it while you prefer to save. Perhaps you feel they’re too tight with the purse strings.

Whatever the issue, money can quickly cause problems.

Solution:

One of the tips to fix old relationship issues regarding finances is to put those good communication skills to work here and have a serious talk about money. Figure out a budget that you both agree on and stick to it.

Work out a financial plan for your future and take steps towards it together.Make crystal clear agreements and keep them.

We all change as we move through life. Maybe you were both ambitious once, but now you’d rather live a quiet life. Perhaps your partner is no longer enthusiastic about your shared dream of buying a house by the sea.

Changing priorities can cause a lot of conflicts.

Solution:

Look for what you both still have in common while allowing your partner to change and grow. Embrace who they are now instead of pining for the past.

If you have different priorities about major lifestyle issues, look for common ground, and compromise that you are both happy with.

It’s easy to lose your temper when it feels like you’re the one taking out the trash for the hundredth time in a row, or you get home from overtime to find the house is a tip. Chore wars are a leadingcause of conflict in relationships.

Solution:

Agree together on who is responsible for what, and stick to it—factorin a little flexibility for when one of you is much busier than usual.

If you both have different ideas of what constitutes a neat home, it might be time for a little compromise.

Problems with your sex life are stressful and can have a big impact on your relationship. If one of you isn’t happy or you’re finding you have widely differentintimacyneeds, it’s time for a serious talk.

Solution:

Carve out time for intimacy.Arrange for someone else to take the kids once a week, or make the most of any time you have alone at home together.

Sex keeps you feeling physically and emotionally close, so make sure you are both happy with yoursex life.

It doesn’t come as a surprise to you thatbad bosses compel good workers to quit? Up to75% quit their jobnot because of the position itself, but because of their boss who never expressed appreciation.

Being taken for granted is one of the fundamental reasons for breakups.

Solution:

Appreciation is what keeps us motivated and committed,both in our work and our relationships.

Remembering to complimentor notice the things our partner shows, we are grateful and increases the overall satisfaction with the relationship. Sayingthank yougoes a long way.

Having kids is a blessing, but it requires a lot of dedication and effort. This can cause astrain on the relationshipwhen partners disagree on the way they want to raise children, address problems that occur, and spend family time.

Solution:

Talk to your partner about why they think something should be done differently and share your reasoning. Often, we are repeating or trying to avoid patterns we were raised by.

Get together and spend some time understanding where the need to do things a certain way is coming from. When you understand, you can change and create a new way to parent that works for your family.

When we find the person, we love we want to share everything with them and to have them do the same. However, this can lead to feelings of losing one’s individuality, feeling of freedom, and a sense of accomplishment.

Solution:

What does it take for you to be your own person while being their partner? Think of areas that you want to keep to yourself that give you a feeling of achievement and freedom.

It might be a hobby or doing sports. Talk to your partner so they don’t feel rejected by this new change and introduce it gradually.

What each of us defines as infidelity and where we draw the line can differ. Infidelity means various things to different people. Infidelity can encompass, besides the sexual act, flirting, sexting or kissing.

When infidelity has occurred, trust is broken, and a person can feel betrayed.This can snowball into many other issues and problems.

Solution:

Talking about what infidelity is for you and your partner is important. They may hurt you inadvertently because, for example, they don’t find flirting a problem.

When something has already occurred, there is a choice to be made. A couple can try to regain trust and rebuild orend the relationship. In case the first one is chosen, seeking professional help can be a wise decision.

Figuring out marriage challenges and solutions and learning how to work out relationship problems is much more productive withcounseling.

When there is a critical difference in core values, the way partners approach life, and challenges, issues are bound to happen.

For example, it might be that they are more spontaneous or hedonistic, while you plan more and save rather than spend. Nonetheless, if your views and expectations from life differ considerably, you are bound to argue.

Solution:

When there are core dissimilarities between you, you might wonder if you are suited for each other. The answer is – it depends. What kind of change would you both need to undertake for this relationship to survive?

Are you willing you make that change, and how much will it “cost” you? If you decide you can and want to change, by all means, give it a go. This is the only way you will know if the change is enough for this relationship to succeed.

You might be in ahappy relationshipfor a long time before noticing the first signs of jealousy. They might act fine at first but slowly change.

They start asking for your whereabouts, distrusting you, checking up on you, distancing or stifling you, and demonstrating concern about your affection towards them.

Often this behavior is a reflection of previous experiencesthat were triggered by something that happened in the current relationship.

Solution:

Both partners need to make an effort. If your partner is jealous, try to be transparent, predictable, honest, and share. Give them time to get to know you and trust you.

However, for this to be solved, they need to make a separate effort to change their anticipations and work out their concerns. There is a difference between privacy and secrecy, and this line needs to be redrawn.

If you are human, you haveunrealistic expectations; no one is free of them. Nowadays, we might expect our partner to play many major roles: the best friend, trusted companion, business partner, lover, etc.

We might expect our partner to know what we want without saying it, advocate fairness at all times, or strive to change the other into what you desire them to be.

This can lead to misunderstandings, repeated quarrels, and misfortune.

Solution:

If you want to solve a problem, you need to comprehend it first.Ask yourself – what is it that you feel entitled to? If you could wave a magic wand and change things, how would the new, pink reality look like?

What are you doing at the moment that you feel could get you there?

When you grasp what you are expecting to happen, but reality and your partner are depriving you of it, you can start to look for ways to ask differently or ask for different wishes.

So many things on the task list, and there is only one of you. How long ago did you stop including things to do with your partner on that list? Drifting apart happens bit by bit, and we don’t notice.

You might wake up one morning and realize you can’t remember the last time you had sex, a date, or a conversation that is more than organizational.

Solution:

A relationship is like a flower, and it can not blossom without nourishment.When you notice the signs, it is time to act. It will take time to cross the distance that has been created, but it is possible.

Prioritize your time together, bring back old habits and activities you did together, laugh, and take time to reconnect.

When life hits us hard, we cope with it the best we know. However, often our coping skills are not enough, and we need support.Lack of support from a partnercan lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed.

Long-lasting lack of support also affects the way we value the relationship we are in, and satisfaction drops significantly.

Solution:

If you don’t ask, the answer is certainly “no.” Talking about what we need and what we can provide can clear the air of unrealistic expectations.

Unspoken and unfulfilled needs lead to negative beliefs about the relationship.

Understanding what our partner can provide helps adjust what we come to them for and look for alternative sources of support while our partner works on becoming one of the main pillars of encouragement and comfort again.

Substance addiction can put a serious strain on a relationship.

Partner’s addiction can cause a significant effect on the family budget, cause many arguments, increase trust issues, cause ignorance and neglect of children and other family members, and impair overall relationship happiness.

Solution:

Couple problems can be worked out with couplestherapy. Counseling can be enormously helpful as it helps both partners deal with the issues arising simultaneously.

Understanding what triggers prompt addiction and building new habits as a couple promotes healthier ways of addressing problems. Individual therapy is recommended as well for both partners.

It can help understand the roots and patterns leading to addiction, and provide support to the non-addicted partner.

Do you find yourself in a current relationship uncomfortable with the speed the relationship is progressing?

You might find your new partner moving more rapidly, wanting to spend more time together, constantly calling or texting, wanting to go away together, or you meeting their family?

Alternatively, you could be in a relationship that is not progressing the way you hoped it would, and the milestones you desired are not being reached.

When you and your partner need different speeds and intensities of intimacy andcommitment, you may argue.

This can lead to becoming terribly upset over seemingly little things, pulling away, and questioning whether this person is for you.

Solution:

Don’tsweep things under the rug rather address what is happening.Avoiding problems is not the best relationship solution.

What kind of reassurance or demonstration of love would bring you back on the same level? How are your needs different, and what can each of you do to find the middle ground?

When one of the partners avoids taking responsibility, it can cause severe damage to the partnership. Money struggles, child neglect, fighting over chores, or playing theblame gamecan happen daily.

One of the most detrimental factors to the relationship is a significantly uneven distribution of responsibility amongst partners.

Solution:

When addressing this issue, the first thing to do is to stop the blaming game. If change is to occur, you need to look forward, not backward. If the change is to be long-lasting, it needs to happen gradually.

Overwhelming a partner to make up for all this time of dodging responsibilities will just prove they were right to steer clear of them.

Give forgiving a shot as ithas been linked to relationship success. Also, agree on the pace of change and the first things to share accountability for.

Controlling behavior happens when one of the partners expects the other to behave in certain ways, even at the expense of the wellbeing of the other partner.

This kind of toxic behavior deprives the other partner’s freedom, confidence, and a sense of self-worth.

Solution:

Controlling behavior is a learned pattern of behavior from primary family or previous relationships.

At one point in life, this was beneficial for the controlling partner, and they need to learn to express affection differently. Speak up,set boundariesand adhere to them, and, if possible, try couples counseling.

All relationships undergo periods of fun and boredom.However, when the feeling of monotony and apathy color, most of the days, it is time to react.

Allowing to fall into a daily routine and go with the flow can lead to decreased libido and overallsatisfaction with the relationship.

Solution:

Think back to the honeymoon phase and recall the things you did as a newly formed couple. What is available from that list today, and what do you still feel you could enjoy?

Make a conscious decision to add spontaneity into the relationship to start the upward spiral to a more eventful relationship.

All couples are exposed to outside influences and opinions on how things should be done.

Some influences are benign, like grandparents’ occasional babysitting, while others can be detrimental, like disapproval of one spouse by the family or friends of the other.

Solution:

Your relationship comes first, and everyone else’s opinion is secondary. Show each other support and that you are a united front against the world.

To resist the influence, you can limit the amount of time spent with or personal information you share with the family members or friends trying to impact you.

Marital problems and solutions may appear quite similar on the outside, but no one knows better than you what you need to make it work.

Arguments are a part of every relationship. However, the way fights are led, and what is their outcome can have a big impact on the relationship.

Disagreement can be helpful or destructive, depending on what you do with them. Having the same fight over and over, losing your temper, or saying things you regret later is bound to make you feel it’s not worth it.

Solution:

After an argument, you should feel you have made progress in understanding where your partner is coming from.

A good fight is one after which you have agreed on what can be the first step both will take to resolve the issue. Start by listening to hear the other side, not only by waiting for your turn.

Research together ways to fight better and only ever focus on the next step needed to take.

When you keep blaming and recalling mistakes each of you has made, you are keeping a virtual scoreboard of each other’s faults. If being right is more important than being with the other person, the relationship is doomed.

This leads up to a build-up of guilt, anger, and bitterness and doesn’t solve any problems.

Solution:

Deal with each problem separately unless they are legitimately connected. Focus on the problem at hand and speak your mind. Don’t let it build up and mention it months later.

Decide if you want tosave the relationshipand if you do, learn to accept the past as is and start focusing on where to go from here.

In a relationship, it’s usually the priority to nurture and develop the connection. When life is a persistent inconvenience, it means one or both of you were not necessarily ready to get involved, and that can happen.

Solution:

Unexpected encounters with another person occur all the time. But when they do, it’s essential to allow it to flourish- placing it first over the chaos.

When the two of you notice you put the union on the back burner, it’s time to make a conscious effort with reprioritizing the other person regardless of your day-to-day situation to battle the new relationship struggles.

Every relationship has problems, but when you first connect, you don’t want to go in with the idea that you can’ttrustthe other person. If this isbaggage from a past relationship, that’s unfair and self-defeating for any new partnership.

Solution:

If your new partner made a promise and then lied to get out of it, that will create mistrust early on. That’s tough to get back. In an effort to do so, one piece of advice on relationship problems is that there needs to be much transparency and commitment in keeping your word moving forward.

Perhaps in the first few weeks of dating, your life goals appear to be similar, but a profound life circumstance changes your perspective on where you see yourself in the future or maybe your mate’s.

Solution:

The change is not in keeping with what the two of you discussed. In this situation, you can find a way to get your partner to see things from your point of view, or the partnership won’t be possible.

These are the kinds of issues in relationships that are difficult to overcome. Often differences in life goals are deal-breakers.

New relationship problems can include a lack of manners in numerous ways. Pleasantries like telling someone they look nice or saying thank you, or expressing how much you appreciate something they’ve done wane after a few dates.

Solution:

It shouldn’t—unfortunately, comfortability and taking a partner for granted set in quickly. If you notice this early on, say something, but also make sure to lead by example. Be the first to tell your mate these things often.

You’ll know you have early relationship problems if your mate is continuously on their phone when you’re together. That’s incredibly rude behavior for anyone when they’re with other people for any reason, let alone being on a date or in the earlystages of a partnership.

Solution:

The focus should be on time spent with each other since free time is precious with the world’s hectic pace. When this happens at the start of a partnership, it won’t get better with time. It needs to be addressed and stopped to strengthen your union ultimately.

Relationships are marathons

Most relationship problems and ways of fixing relationship problems would be something that you must have heard about or experienced; still, when it comes to utilizing this common knowledge, not everyone is thorough with the implementation.

It’s not difficult to answer “how to solve marriage problems,” and there is plenty of advice on relationship issues and solutions.

However, when it comes to solving marriage issues and relationship issues advice, everything boils down to effort and implementation.

These common problems in relationships are not completely avoidable, and every couple runs into some of them at one point.

The good news is, working on relationship problems can produce a considerable difference and get your relationship back on track, free from all relationship difficulties.

Be creative, don’t give up on each other, and you will reach the solution.

Intimate relationships that last seem rare these days. They survive only when people have the capacity to find shared ground, commit to one another, and overcome challenges. Relationship issues are common, but there are a number of tried-and-true methods for dealing with each relationship issue.

We’re looking at 15 of the most common relationship problems couples tend to have, discussing what you can do to solve them, and howrelationship counseling onlinecan help. With the proper mindset and knowledge, you and your partner can be on the way to a happy and healthy relationship and better mental health.

If people in a relationship can master communication, you’ll be far less likely to experience other common relationship problems.

Effective, honest communication is essential to relationship success.

Strengthen your relationship through couples therapy you can participate in together or apart, at your convenience.

Different people communicate differently. You may be quiet while your partner is talkative. Regardless of your communication styles, relationships need effective, regular communication to thrive as a unit.

“Most couples see me for help with communication. It is really challenging to stay connected, still feel aligned, and intimate while also walking away from a conversation feeling as though we worked through an issue. Setting up, typically two very different people, with this idea that they’re on the same team can be the switch that gets them to this place.”

Talkspace therapist Meaghan Rice, PsyD, LPC

Maybe you’ve stopped communicating the way you used to; it’s a common relationship problem for many couples. For some couples, every conversation has an edge of confrontation. Others might forget what communication is supposed to entail and how important it is to happiness. To improve communication and emotional connection in your romantic relationship, try focusing on the following:

Communication is a two-way street that both people need to focus on together. If you want your romantic relationship to work in the long run, effective communication should be a priority. The good thing is, there are many usefulcommunication exercises for couplesto practice.

Relevant debates are healthy and important for self-expression. However, spiteful arguments are hurtful and serve no good purpose. Successful couples have rules for arguing, such as:

If you have the urge to say something spiteful to your partner, ask yourself what you’re feeling first. Are you angry? Are you sad? Are your feelings hurt? Are you frustrated? What are you unhappy about?

Make a regular time to sit down and discuss developing issues before they build up and become problems or relationship challenges. Express yourselves peacefully, with forethought and a level of maintained respect, instead of simmering, boiling, and exploding on each other. Need help resolving this relationship issue?Couples therapy techniquesmight help you. If you are having trouble controlling your anger and frustration towards your partner, our guide on how tocontrol anger in a relationshipmight also help.

With time, every long term relationship will change. Some of what used to seem most important might begin to not even phase you anymore. Additionally, as things in the relationship change, you and your romantic partner may also be changing in different ways, evolving as individuals.

This doesn’t mean that your long term relationship can’t continue working. It just means that you need to make the effort to spend some intentional time rediscovering one another.

It’s not realistic to expect that people will stay the same throughout their entire life. People age, grow, adapt, and are fundamentally changed in various ways by their life experiences.

It’s important to stay close as a couple, even when you’re changing as individuals. Talk with each other and honestly discuss how you each see the future evolving. Enjoy discovering how you’re both growing as human beings. Change in a healthy relationship can be exciting.

Many relationship problems are sex-based. Ask yourself what you want sexually. Be honest and open with yourself. Encourage your partner to do the same. Then, get together and discuss what you both want.

Be mutually respectful of each other’s desires and needs. The chances are, you’ll both be pleasantly surprised and excited to make some changes in your sex life. Of course, some sexual problems will require professional help to get through. In some cases, you or your partner might have afear of intimacythat’s impacting your sex life. Doing couples therapy with a sex therapist can be a huge asset to any relationship. Explore this option before losing hope.

If your partner cheated on you, you’ll have to decide for yourself if you can forgive them, or if you’ll need to move on without them in your life.

Most affairs don’t typically happen spontaneously. Infidelity can also come in the form of emotional cheating, too. If you want the relationship to survive post-affair, you’ll both need to be honest about what happened, and then work together to solve any underlying issues.

Cheating hurts, and it can take years to get over. While many relationships can endure after someone has an affair, it requires a firm commitment from both partners for them to learnhow to get over infidelity.

The simple fact is life requires money, and couples argue about finances. Financial pressure is a common relationship problem that can lead to catastrophic relationship issues, and even mental health problems, when not addressed properly. Research shows thatmore than halfof all couples enter a marriage already in debt.

It’s wise to have a clear understanding with your partner about who’s responsible for what in terms of money. A basic budget is simple to develop and can go a long way toward avoiding unnecessary arguments. For more tips, learnhow to talk to your partner about money.

External pressures fromtraumatic life eventscan stress any relationship. The death of a loved one, financial strain, disease diagnosis, chronic stress, past abuse, domestic violence, or anything else that you or your partner has endured can affect emotional and physical health. Don’t shut your partner out. You’re a team. Be there for each other, even through the rough times. For more tips, learnhow to deal with traumaindividually.

Everyone likes feeling appreciated for their efforts. Whether you have a fast-paced career, or you take care of the home, it’s important to feel valued for the things you do that make your partner’s life more enjoyable. Expressing appreciation regularly can ensure you’ll both feel more noticed in the relationship, even if it’s just for something simple.

Parenting can be very difficult if you haven’t developed a cohesive plan and a firm commitment to stick to. This is especially true in the case of step-parenting. If you’re raising children from previous relationships together, definitive house rules are necessary. Talk with your partner in private about any parenting issues, andalwayspresent a unified front.

It can be hard to keep a relationship exciting, but relationships are work. You need to put in time and effort to keep the romance alive and stay engaged with your partner. If you feel like your relationship is in a rut, plan something different to help spice things up again.

Many people struggle over responsibilities at home. If you start to feel resentment about who’s doing what (or whoisn’tdoing what), keep the lines of communication open and be sure you’re sharing your frustration.

Let your partner know you need help. Be specific with what you want. Then — and this is important — resist the urge to correct how they accomplish a task. The only thing you’re doing by reloading that dishwasher “your way” is telling them that they should just let you do it in the first place next time.

Trust is one of the most important aspects of any relationship. If you’re questioning whether or not you can trust your partner, calmly yet firmly ask them if there’s reason for concern.

If your partner is the one who has trust issues, reassure them they have nothing to worry about.

The good news is that you can overcometrust issues in a relationship.

Feeling safe in a relationship is important. Verbal, emotional, or physical abuse cannot be tolerated. Any form of abuse should be taken seriously and addressed immediately. If you need help and are in anabusive relationship cycle, you can reach out to theNational Domestic Violence Hotlineat any time.

Goals are important, and when two people in a relationship are aligned in terms of what they want out of life, it can be wonderful. Sometimes, however, goals change. If you and your partner can’t get on the same page with what you both want in the future, it can cause problems. Talking about your goals and being realistic about what each of you wants will be important throughout the duration of your relationship.

It’s not uncommon for a couple to have the same fight over and over, but when disagreements start to escalate, or problems begin to manifest in other ways, it can be problematic for the relationship. Be sure that you’re addressing the root of the problem, so that you can attempt to change the behaviors and thought processes you both develop after so long.

If your relationship seems substandard in any way, and you want to fix it, it’s simple to begin. It can also be a lot of fun,ifyou’re both dedicated to the process.

“To start fixing issues in a relationship, the highest levels of success depend on each partner’s willingness to show up and take ownership of their contribution. Having an impartial lens of a professional helps to navigate this journey, but even individually-carving out space, having real conversations about issues, and always bringing creative solutions to the table can start the trajectory in a positive direction.”

Talkspace therapist Meaghan Rice, PsyD, LPC

Remembering to implement any or all of the following can be beneficial in any relationship:

If you want to solve your relationship issues, remember what it was that first attracted you to your partner. Ask yourself where the relationship problem is stemming from, and then take action to improve the situation. Be honest with your partner and enjoy rediscovering the excitement of your love. Get connected with a couples therapist at Talkspace to start working on your relationship challenges.

Many relationships lose their spark over time, but it isn’t always a sign that things are broken beyond repair. What might feel like a dying relationship can often be saved or restored with a mutual commitment to making things work.

You’ve heard it a million times, but it bears repeating: even the strongest relationships face challenges.

Building a happy, healthy partnership takes work and may not always be easy, especially when there’s been a breach of trust.

“Issues are a part of life and a part of being in a relationship,” says clinical psychologistStone Kraushaar. “And the goal is to not fixate on the past, but work to create together in a meaningful way.”

So, you do you go about that? Here are some tips to get you started, whether you’re dealing with the fallout from a betrayal or trying to keep a long-distance relationship going.

Anytime trust is broken, there’s going to be a rift in the relationship. It might bepainful to face, but leaving these issues unaddressed won’t help anyone in the long run.

If there has beeninfidelityor trust has been broken, it’s important to take full responsibility for what happened and be understanding of how your behavior hurt your partner.

Avoid becoming defensive or sidestepping your mistake, but don’t fall into self-loathing either. “You should own it in a loving way that creates the space to start to rebuild trust,” says Kraushaar.

If you’ve hurt your partner, it’s easy to fall into a spiral of shame and disappointment in yourself. But that’s not going to help either of you.

Rather than spend all your time beating yourself up over what you did wrong, try shifting that energy toward showingcare and compassionto your partner.

While you have every right to feel hurt and angry, there should be adesire to work onthe relationship.

“Trust can never be restored until the person whose trust was broken allows their partner a chance to earn it back,” Kraushaar affirms.

Instead ofbottling up emotions, Kraushaar encourages people to be “radically transparent” with each other about what has hurt them. This involves truly getting it all out there, even if you feel a bit silly or self-conscious admitting certain things.

If you’re the one who broke the trust, this also involves being radically transparent with yourself about what motivated you to do so. Was it simply a lapse in judgement? Or was it anattempt to sabotagea situation you didn’t know how to get out of?

Broken trustcan take a tollon everyone in the relationship.

If there’s been a significant breach, consider working together with aqualified therapistwho specializes in relationships and can provide guidance for healing.

Being physically apart more often than not can be rough on a relationship.Keeping the romance alivetakes extra effort on everyone’s part.

Have a discussion with your partner about your exclusiveness and commitment to each other. What does this look like for each of you? What are you comfortable and uncomfortable with?

Beinghonest and upfrontabout your expectations from the beginning can prevent things from going wrong down the road.

“It’s so important that couples know and have scheduled visits and can look forward to those times and plan to make them special,” notes Kraushaar.

In fact, research hasshownthat long-distance relationships where partnershave a reunion plannedare less stressful and more satisfying.

If you’re not able to organize scheduled time together due to significant distance or finances, Kraushaar recommends setting up regularonline dateswith a theme or specific focus.

Don’t just go for your usualconversation topics. Cook a meal together, watch a movie while you keep the video chat open, play a virtual game, or even read a short story aloud, taking turns.

While it’s important to pay attention to fostering closeness in a long-distance relationship, that aspect shouldn’t consume you.

No matterhow much you missthem, don’t forget about other important areas of your life.

Keep up with your hobbies and interests — a happy and healthy relationship involves each partner being their own person.

No matter how you dice it, going through a rough patchwhen you live togetheris stressful.

Kraushaar recommends setting up a specific time each week or so that allows youto talk aboutmore difficult topics, such as money,sex, and trust so that these don’t bleed over into all of your interactions.

All relationships require give and take. When you’re living in close quarters, being accommodating of their needs and preferences without sacrificing your own can help foster more happiness and fulfillment.

Consider working out some kind of temporary agreement that allows each of you to unwind at home alone.

For example, maybe you stay a little later the gym on Tuesdays and Thursdays, while they hang out with a friend on Mondays and Wednesdays.

Spending time with friends can have apowerful effecton your personal mental health and can help strengthen your personal identity.

Remember, staying connected to your partner meanshaving a lifeoutside of your relationship.

Kraushaar encourages partners to regularly hug each other in a fully present and connected way. Holding hands or huggingreleases oxytocinwhich can reduce stress and boost your mood.

If you’re not on great terms right now, this might be easier said than done. Trystarting slow— simply putting your hand on theirs can help to show that you still care.

Deep-levelintimacyis about creating a satisfying and meaningful relationship that isn’t always based onromantic expression.

Sure, many people want to be swept off their feet from time to time, but it’s important to genuinely respect and enjoy your partners for who they are outside of what they can give you.

Picking up the pieces after a big fight can feel like an impossible task. Try these techniques to help you each move forward.

Once tempers have calmed down, it’s important to make sure you each have a chance to get your points across. Try to give each personspace to communicatetheir point of view.

“Being open and honest about one’s thoughts and intentions about the relationship itself and the future can restore — or newly create — a sense of safety” in the relationship, says Montreal psychologist and relationship specialistZofia Czajkowska, PhD.

In order for you partner to truly hear you, it’simportant to communicatewhat you’re really feeling below all the tension.

For example, avoid accusatory phrases, such as, “You did this to me!” Instead, aim for something along the lines of, “When X happens I feel Y and I think it would be helpful if you could do Z to reassure me or prevent that from happening in the future.”

If you catch yourself forming a rebuttal in your head as someone is talking to you, you’re notreally listening. “You’re getting ready to defend yourself or go to battle,” says Czajkowska.

“Winning” an argument is never truly winning, she adds. “If your partner feels that they lost, it will likely contribute to more distance, tension, and resentment, so in the long run, you lose too.”

When rebuilding the relationship, Czajkowska advises to consider ita new one, rather than saving an old one.

“Seeing it this way creates an opportunity for defining rules andboundariesfrom the beginning,” says Czajkowska.

This means striving to understand and work through underlying issues as well as letting go of past resentments you’ve been holding onto.

A lack of passion orcase of the “mehs”doesn’t automatically mean your relationship is beyond repair.

Spend a week noticing or writing down all the things your partner does “right.”

Peopletend to seewhat they’re looking for. If you’re looking for reasons to be mad or upset with your partner, you’ll probably find them. But this works in reverse, too. Keep your eyes peeled for the good things.

Similarly, don’t just silently observe your partner’s right-doings.

When they do something that’s kind of helpful, even if it’s just tidying up the kitchen after a meal,verbally thank them.

Sometimes, you just fall into a rut. It might sound cliche, but setting aside some time,even just a few hours, to go do something out of the ordinary can make a big difference.

Psychologicalresearchshows that partners who play together experience more positive emotions and report greater happiness.

Here are a few ideas to get you started:

Establish how to take care of each otheremotionally, advises Czajkowska.

What does this actually mean? For starters, commit to giving each other a heads up when it feels like you’re drifting apart.

Sit down together and look at what might be causing that. Have you each been wrapped up in work? Has it been too long since you spent the day just enjoying each other’s company?

“Commitment to working on the relationship is just as important as commitment to the partner,” she emphasizes.

How you save a damaged relationship can depend on the cause of the damage but most strategies involve restoring trust, intimacy, and communication and making a commitment to repairing the relationship. Consulting with a professional, such as a couples therapist, may help provide specific strategies you can try.

You may be able to save a dying relationship if you and your partner commit to rebuilding it. Some strategies to try include active listening, compromise, honesty, and communication. More specific advice can depend on the reasons your relationship is damaged.

You can potentially restore a relationship by both partners making a commitment to noticing the things the other does right, having fun together, and finding ways to take care of each other emotionally by building intimacy.

You may be able to save a relationship by remembering or rediscovering the things you like about your partner, engaging in physical contact if both partners want to, and doing things to have fun and make memories together, like attending a one-time class.

Ultimately, you’ll need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth the work that’s required to save it from a low point.

It’s also wise to make sure everyone involved is committed to saving the relationship. If you’rethe only one willingto put in the work, reconciliation probably isn’t likely.

That said,abuse of any kind, whether it’s physical,verbal, oremotional, is a red flag. Keep in mind that signs oftoxicitycan be quite subtle. Are you walking on eggshells around your partner? Have you lost your confidence or sense of self?

If you have any inkling that you might be experiencing abuse of any kind,considerreaching out to theNational Domestic Violence Hotlineat 800-799-SAFE (7233).

How can I improve my social life?




I Improved My Social Skills As FAST As I Could - HERE'S HOW - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-AoFVwbWew

Transcript:
(00:00) - What I'm gonna cover here comes from over 15 years of me working on my social skills. This isn't from some books. To be honest I haven't found any good books when it comes to social skills, it's terrible. It's a lot of speculation, a lot of academic thinking. A lot of what sounds good in your mind but it doesn't come from real life experience.
(00:27) I'm someone who from 2006 on, went out in the real world, not in books, real world and started interacting with people. I've talked to more people than the average person normally would in their entire life. I've talked to more people than probably all of you combined. - Whoa. - No joke. And this here is part one of getting good socially.
(00:53) It will come down to a lot of inner work but there is an external side where hey, you've gotta work on yourself, that's the authenticity part but then you have to also work on the connecting to others part. You want to connect to others, you better know how to read others. How to read them emotionally, how to put yourself in their shoes.
(01:15) It's called empathy, advanced empathy and how to know exactly what would make sense, what wouldn't make sense. What would connect, what wouldn't? And calibrate to them. The only way you're going to develop this feel is by talking to a lot of people and knowing exactly what to look for and recognizing the different patterns between all of those people.
(01:36) So keep that in mind. You want to get good talking to people, talk to a lot of people. Take charge of your social life and talk to more people than you naturally should. Say you were to talk to 30 people a day, time passes, guess what? That's a lot of experience under your belt. But, as I mentioned, that will be on the connecting side.
(01:59) On the expression, authenticity side, that is work that you will have to do on the inside. Because it's the foundation. Meaning if you go out and you're anxious and you're scared and you start pretending to be someone that you're not, you start putting on this front, you start trying to act confident or act fake, well then guess what? Will those references help, no.
(02:26) Because they will all be coming from the front. Not you. Even in terms of seeing what clicks or not you're not gonna know authentically if you click and with who. Even in terms of getting good references, it's not you who's getting validated but the front. So it'll actually hurt your self esteem and hurt your confidence.
(02:44) It's gonna keep saying, "I am only liked when I'm pretending to be this." Versus, "I am liked for me." So you'll have to learn how to crack open that front, tap into the real you. You've been disconnected from a very long time. This is also why advice like be yourself is very accurate but most people don't know how to be themselves.
(03:03) Who you think yourself is isn't really you. It's the front that you've put on and been the majority of your life. So letting go internally, unleashing authenticity and then from there, getting a lot of reference experiences. At a most basic level, you can break down social skills as, okay? Social skills, you have on one side, 80% of what I call emotional skills.
(03:35) And on the other side, it's 20% of what I call analytical skills. Emotional skills, analytical skills. Emotional is everything that has to do with the vibe. Okay? For example, if you're someone who is very anxious, that's an emotional skill. If you're someone who gets stuck in your head, that's an emotional skill.
(04:03) If you run out of things to say, that's an emotional skill. If you can't have fun, that's an emotional skill. If you can't express your true self, that's an emotional skill. Analytical skill, as we talked about, this is the foundation. This you will develop through reference experiences.
(04:22) The right reference experiences. This will come down to, you could say polishing that natural vibe. If you've ever heard the term social natural before, it's a thing. Someone who's gone through a certain conditioning, a certain life and they just feel very comfortable socially. You might have some friends like that.
(04:43) No matter where you go, they can easily talk to people. Everyone just likes them, likes talking to them. They gravitate towards them. You know if that person comes out to a dinner or something they're gonna make it fun. All right, a social natural. That's the emotional skills. Emotional skills alone will get you to that point of being, ah a social natural.
(05:02) You can kind of just be loose, be yourself but then you do need, as we talked about, the analytical to make sure it connects with others and to even polish that expression of you. And this here, you could simplify it as content. Vibe, content. Big mistake people do is they try to work on the vibe and the emotional skills using their analytical mind.
(05:31) No, that looks like, "Okay I run out of things to say. "What are some, if I analyze this and think, "some ways I can not run out of things to say? "What are maybe some stories I can memorize "or some things I could fall back on?" Et cetera, et cetera. Terrible, that doesn't solve anything.
(05:53) What solves the emotional skills? One thing and one thing alone, it's two words. - [Audience Member] Letting go. - Yes. Letting go. Letting go is what gets you to become a social natural. All of you were born as social naturals, all of you. All of you were way less stifled as children versus you here today.
(06:20) All of you were. This isn't something that's missing within you, it's something that you've buried inside. As you started growing up, you started getting a bit more worried. "What do people think of me? "Oh is that how I sound?" No baby is, "Wah, is that how I sound?" No kid's thinking that.
(06:37) That comes later on. You started judging yourself, trauma happened and ultimately you started disowning and hiding your true self and putting on this front that you've now basically become. Who am I? The front. And you've lost touch with authenticity. Letting go gets you back in touch with that. Letting go, guess what? Allows you to no longer get triggered.
(07:04) Social anxiety, that's you getting triggered. Until you identify why you get triggered, where that comes from, the original trauma, nothing's gonna change. You could try to progressively desensitize yourself which is sadly what most people do and that'll give you some results but it's not all the way.
(07:22) And it's not permanent. As soon as you stop doing your little challenges, you fall back. Letting go, that's the foundation and it'll get you 80% of the way. It's actually the highest ROI thing you could do with talking to a lot of people. Is actually letting go. And sometimes it baffles me when people are like, "Oh I like this letting go stuff Julien "but what about the social skills?" That is social skills.
(07:44) If you can't see letting go gets you 80% of the way, then you're too far gone and your IQ is far too low. Okay? And this is also very important when I say the biggest ROI thing you can do. Vibe is more important than content. You can also analyze in terms of socially, if you're someone who's just very, very analytical, hey you need to do a lot of letting go and work on the emotional skills.
(08:15) You need to learn especially socially, to get out of your head. To unlock what I call your full instrument. Meaning not just speaking like this with the mouth and the lips but with the body. Notice that, with the body. That there, old me, right? Back in 2006, all shy, stifled. I couldn't do that. No technique, no line is gonna get me to do that.
(08:46) You can't force that. Forcing that would look like, "With the body." That's forcing it. Very different no? You can sense there's not that same depth to it and it's a lot more at you. With the body. Hey everyone, you like how loud I am? Does it make sense? Like you like it with the body.
(09:08) (audience laughs) With the body. One, the voice is going, grounded. The voice goes down. With the body, with the body. My voice is actually shooting down here. Loud, shooting down. Yet it projects a lot more. Reels people in more. This isn't something that happens by force, it comes from letting go. Okay? You could think of it too.
(09:40) As taking a shit. People are constipated as fuck and they're trying to shit. Socially, they're like really stifled. That's their instrument. It's super constipated and they're like come on, come on. Express yourself and you'll hear their voice. Literally it's like a little string of shit going, "Hey.
(10:01) "My name's Jeremiah. "Come on shit, get out of my mouth." And then they might try to be loud. Like, "Hey, hey, hey there." Trying to shoot the shit out. And they're like maybe more, just forcing it. Terrible, people sense that, it's weird. It's too much, it's offputting.
(10:21) And you can just sense that person's constipated. On the flip side you also see people who are constipated who just suck it up. It's like I'm just tOo shy to even try to express it. So you'll either have the person super constipated, not talking. Or constipated and trying to force a little string out.
(10:35) Letting go dilutes the anus. (audience member laughs) So that it just. Naturally, effortlessly, just all comes out. And that's when you tap into your true power. That is the best way to illustrate this. Are you trying to force out your vibe? Or are you diluting and just letting it out. Just (imitates explosion).
(11:07) That's power. That's also getting out of your head 'cause then you're not wasting all that energy trying to force something out. Then you can allocate that energy to pattern recognition. Putting yourself in the other person's shoes. To forward willpower. This is important. If you're really shy and anxious and stifled, you're trying to hide all that, you're trying to micromanage how people think, there's all that worry.
(11:35) You're burning a ton of energy and willpower. Energy and willpower that is necessary if you want to truly express yourself and make sure it connects with someone. Guess what? Right now, this event, am I using a lot of energy and willpower speaking right now? Yes or no? - No. - No. - Yes. Kidding me, yes. (audience laughs) To craft a speech like this requires a lot of concentration and willpower, it has to make sense.
(12:00) Like as I'm talking now I'm already just playing chess, thinking three, four moves ahead of how this is gonna link to what I say then. I'm also thinking, "Okay for them to understand this concept, "I need to say this first. "I need to say it in this order. "I'm gonna use this story, I'm gonna use this joke.
(12:13) " It's a ton, it's very mentally intense. What allows me to do this, while also remaining flowy and fun and at ease is by having access to all of my energy, focus and willpower and I can't be burning it backwards. Fighting against myself, stuffing stuff down. That's why people mess up. If all your energy is like, "Oh be cool, oh don't show the anxiety.
(12:40) " You have 10% left on what you're saying and forward-focused. Good luck with that. 10% left in terms of even analyzing your references. Most people don't even remember their references, how are you gonna grow from that? So letting go is also what gets you out of that. Reclaiming all that power which really accelerates your growth and then in terms of what reels people in on a charismatic level.
(13:04) We always get so obsessed with the content right? Like what are some cool stories to say that's gonna reel someone in? Oh give me the little cool stories, the words. It's like, it's the vibe. It's literally the vibe. Vibe is 80%. Of course you can refine and what I call polish the wording but what comes first, what draws someone in is the energy that they put out.
(13:28) You lost, is that your spot? Yes, okay. Favorite example is this. Okay. - [Audience Member] What's up? - Shh or I'm gonna have to kick you out. Okay. Yes, again this is social awareness too. Too in your head, you can't even notice you're disrupting an event. Be aware, number one lesson for you.
(13:50) Wake up, be aware okay? Now the big test, that I always like bringing this back to is this. Say you take two people and there's two scripts for a commercial selling you on this pen. Person number one, they did a ton of test studies on the different words that resonate with the audience. "Oh if you say the word moist when talking about this pen, "it'll really resonate.
(14:15) " So it's all studied and it's this carefully crafted, marketing experts came in. Like the script is perfect. The content is perfect. But let's just say that person's vibe is at a 50%. Take someone else, their script, let's just say there is no study, it's 50% as good as the other one.
(14:36) A worse script but vibe is 100%. Who's gonna be more appealing and captivating? - Second one. - Vibe. - The vibe. Vibe comes first. Master that, 80% of the way there. Then of course add on the content and this is how you see people got it the wrong way. They're working all these words but it just comes off weird, hollow.
(14:58) Even the words itself, what you're saying. What is it supposed to highlight? The vibe. And this is the other big shift is that most people try to go out and socialize and put this front and hide behind this front to distract people from who they are. Hey if I learn these tips and tricks, people won't see that I have nothing to say.
(15:18) If I learn these stories, people will think I'm interesting. If I hide my anxiety, people will think I'm confident. So everything that you're saying or doing is designed to distract people. We call this being a social scammer, sadly most people. A social master, yes there are still some tips and tricks involved in the 20% but they're not meant to distract people from who you are.
(15:42) They're meant to highlight who you are. Saying something, even the story is meant to highlight how awesome your vibe is. Makes sense? Are you, and this is an audit for all of you. Whenever you're talking to someone, are you trying to bring their awareness to who you are or hide and bring it to something that you're not? And at the most basic level this starts by going first and just being real off the bat.
(16:10) If you're going out and you're like, "Okay I need to have more fun." And you even try to jump up to have some more fun, it's better than nothing but you're still scamming. Why are you not having fun by default? Why do you need to do that to have fun? Okay, I need to build my momentum.
(16:25) No, you don't need momentum. Is there such a thing as momentum, of course. But it should play a small role. Meaning I do still get affected by momentum but my starting point is really damn high and the momentum just takes me those extra couple percents. For most people they have nothing, they're all momentum.
(16:48) Not good. That's still scamming. That's the whole, "I'm not in state, now what?" Why are you not in state? Let go and you don't need to make momentum your go to foundation. If you noticed, guess what? I could be quietly standing at the back I walk up, "Hey, how's it going?" I don't need momentum.
(17:09) I don't need to warm up. I don't need to do my two, three minutes. I'm gonna talk a little bit for two, three minutes and warm up. No, 'cause I've done the inner work. There's nothing blocking it. There's nothing I need to fight against. And then here's the other trap, if you're relying on momentum, even if you're relying on different stories or things that you say.
(17:29) That's becomes your source of confidence. It's not coming from you. It's hurting core confidence. There was a comment recently on a video that I put out. Someone's like, "Oh I love that bit of advice." It was just an advice when it comes to conversation skills. It's like oh I like that bit of advice.
(17:47) I feel if you give a lot more bits of advice like that, it's gonna help people with anxiety 'cause then they have all these little bits of tips and tricks they can rely on. And I'm like, "Well okay that's great. "They have their spot yes. "But you don't want that to be your foundation.
(18:02) " Because what is it gonna say? That you are nothing without all the tips and tricks. That's your source of confidence, that's your source of power. Not who you are. You'll always feel not confident without it. Your self esteem will never move up because the good response, the good reference, the good reaction, it's not because of who I am.
(18:24) It's because of the little story. It's because of the tip and trick I saw on YouTube. It actually hurts you. You want your source of power and confidence to just come from who you are. Hey you know what? I can be interesting with a great script, I can be interesting with a boring script. Bring it. And if you're someone who relies way too much on the content give yourself a challenge.
(18:43) Go out and try to talk about the most boring things, yet make them interesting and you will be amazed. Even on a deeper level, what defines something that is interesting? If you find it interesting. If you're interested in it, that vibe, that passion will transfer onto the person and they'll be interested in it too.
(19:05) All right, I actually have a friend, acquaintance who lives in San Francisco, like friend. More of an acquaintance. I'll see him every now and then, he lives in San Francisco, he's a great guy though. And he works in the bar scene, restaurant scene and he's the type of guy where if you go out and you eat something or he orders a drink or something he'll describe kind of like how, if you go to a Michelin Star dinner, in great detail all the subtleties that went into it.
(19:34) So say we're at a restaurant, he's like, "Oh did you know that dish, "they got this from that thing and this?" And the way he talks, content-wise, I mean even if you actually go to a Michelin restaurant, they give you the description, you don't even understand half of what they're saying.
(19:45) You're just like ooh. Like the vibe affects you. Content-wise, I don't really care what he's saying. About this, and then the fish they got it there. Okay cool story but it actually makes the meal way more enjoyable and I get sucked into what he's saying. "Oh did you know that this drink was infused with?" Dadada, it's like, I don't give a fuck but because you're into it, I actually kind of do and I like it.
(20:06) So keep talking about it. Same here. Whatever you're into, actually at a most basic level, I would focus on that. Instead of looking for little cool stories, say hey, what are some real stories from my life that light me up? What are some topics that I could just talk about forever? And try going out and talking about that, see what happens.
(20:27) Try prioritizing the vibe. Anything you say, it's because it highlights and amplifies the vibe. And you'll be surprised. There was even someone, this is many years ago. I still have the video somewhere he was, it might be in Transformation Mastery too. He's, it was in Eastern Europe. It was this older guy, very stifled.
(20:46) Very sad, Eastern Europe and you know, he's like oh hey I got, just all down. And I'm like, "When's the last time you smiled?" He's like, "What's that?" And I'm like "Okay. "When was the last time you were excited?" He's like, "I don't know.
(21:00) " So I'm like, give me one thing you find really interesting, really exciting. And he's like, "Game of Thrones." This was before the finale. (audience laughs) And he was like, really into it. I'm like, "Okay tell me why you like, tell the crowd. "You know what? "Tell the whole crowd why you like 'Game of Thrones'.
(21:18) " And he starts talking, it's like, "'The Game of Thrones'," and at first it's just kind of meek. But suddenly, and you see it in the video, the guy starts getting carried away and he's like, "You know and the writer, they thought about." And he starts getting louder and louder and everyone's like, "What the fuck?" And he's like, "They thought about this and there's this character, "this character named Hodor.
(21:39) " Everyone's like Hodor? He's like, "Yes and they thought about it "for all these years that hold the door is Hodor." Hodor and starts going nuts and everyone's like, "Who is this?" Because he picked a topic that just lit him up. If he does that while out, that is much more charismatic and appealing than him thinking, "What would be something "that someone else would like to hear about?" Maybe I'll interest them with a little bit of content.
(22:06) No you interest them by being interested in it. You interest them with your vibe.

Some people seem naturally blessed with expert social skills and charisma, but social engagements can feel awkward, clumsy, and uncertain for the rest of us.

The good news is you can develop social skills and make your social interactions smoother and more connected. Watch our social skills video to get started, and then keep reading:

So whether you experience social anxiety, want more connection, or just want to sharpen your social chops, let’s learn how!

Social skills are the interpersonal tools, relationship strategies, and soft skills we use to communicate, build connections, and interact with others. They are also called people skills orinterpersonal skills.

Here are the most important social skills to focus on:

Read on to dive deeper and learn tips on cultivating each one!

Social skills are the most overlooked career accelerant. The better your social skills, the easier it is to succeed in all areas. Want a better relationship with your boss? Excellent conversation skills. Want a promotion? Learn to be indispensable on a team. Want to make better friends? Learn how to build rapport and be authentic.

It’s hard to overstate how important social skills are. But here are a few compelling benefits. Strong social skills will help you:

Social skills are not optional extras; they’re fundamental for a successful, happy, and well-rounded life.

Lots of brilliant, creative, interesting people focus so much on their IQ that they forget about their PQ (or interpersonal intelligence). They work so hard acquiring technical skills and job skills that they forget about social skills and people skills.

I believe everyone (especially adults) should have social skills training; social skills are the only universal job skill, after all.

But so few of us have any social skills training at all! It’s assumed that social skills will be learned by osmosis. Parents figure kids will learn them over time, and teachers hope they happen on the playground. Not true!

Now, let’s go over the top social skills and how to practice each!

A key social skill is being a smooth conversationalist, where you engage others in fun small talk as well as meaningful discussions.

Podcasters and talk show hosts are some of the best conversationalists.

Conversation is one of the most important skills because it allows you to connect, understand, and be understood by others. It creates personal and professional connections and makes you a person with whom others want to spend time.

Some of the main components of the conversational skillset are:

The first place to practice this skill is to practice the balance of listening and speaking.

Action Step:Notice in your conversations if you tend to ask more questions or speak more. After each conversation, estimate what percent of the talking you did. If you tend to do under 50%, then in your next conversation, strive to share more! If you tend to speak over 50%, then in your next conversation, strive to ask more questions!

And if you’d like to bring your conversation skills to the next level, you might enjoy this goodie:

Do you struggle with small talk? Do you often run out of things to say or feel awkward and self-conscious in social situations?💪 Speak so people listen,🤐 No more awkward silences,🚫 No more small talk.

Research2https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-01859-007suggests that there are different ways to use humor to foster connection. For example, you might tell a self-deprecating joke to equalize the status in a dynamic, or you could say something silly in a stressful moment to release tension.

But at the heart of all humor is the ability to find laughter, play, and joy in any moment.

Research3https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4779443/also suggests that how much we laugh alongside someone indicates how close we feel to them.

A good comedian knows how to amuse and uplift others without resorting to negativity or offense. If your jokes make others feel bad, then you won’t get invited back to the party!

Here are several types of humor. Which do you resonate with most?

Here are a few steps you can take to improve your humor:

Action Step 1:Read ourin-depth article on how to be funny.

Action Step 2:Take an improv class. This is one of the best ways to practice having fun.

Action Step 3:Practice the art of “yes-and.” This is the fundamental of improv comedy and the best way to practice humor with others. If someone you’re with offers a joke (even a terrible joke), first accept the premise of the joke and then take it one step further. Don’t even worry about being funny—focus more on having fun and being playful, and the laughs will come naturally.

This is where you can captivate an audience or a group of people with your words when you’re sharing something in a way that has everyone lean forward and hang on to your every word.

Being a skilled speaker is helpful because it helps you influence others. You can use your influence to entertain or inspire.

Really, any time you’re speaking to a group, this skill can come in handy. You could use it when you’re leading a meeting, giving a toast, or sharing an opinion with a group of friends.

The one thing great speakers do is absorb attention.

If you are uncomfortable with other people’s attention, you’ll probably rush through what you’re saying or stare at your feet. You might be afraid that if you don’t entertain people, they’ll stop paying attention to you.

But, paradoxically, a great speaker captures attention because they enjoy attention (or are at least comfortable with it). If you can feel comfortable with others’ attention and assume you belong on the “stage,” then you can start to take up space. You can make eye contact with others. Slow down your speaking. And take dramatic pauses.

Science of People founder Vanessa Van Edwards covers a research study in her bookCues, which found that channeling Steve Jobs can actually give you more confidence on stage and make you a better presenter. Who is your speaking role model? Channel them.

Action Step:The next time you’re at dinner with friends or family, challenge yourself to give a toast! It can be short and light-hearted, but take every chance you can to practice being in the limelight. And see if you can act as if your a confident performer.

Additionally, here are15 Science-Based Public Speaking Tips To Be a Master Speaker.

Persuasion is a social skill that allows you to influence others’ opinions, perceptions, and desires.

Being an effective persuader is a crucial social social skill if you want to impact others. Persuasion can help you pitch yourself in a job interview, rally a friend group for a movie outing, or even convince a friend to drop a disagreement.

The core of being persuasive is a combination of understanding people and strategic communication. It’s a skill where you understand what motivates a person’s actions and then speak to their motivation.

Here’s one persuasion tip from Robert Cialdini, author of the bookInfluence.Cialdini writes:

“A well-known principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone to do us a favor, we will be more successful if we provide a reason. People simply like to have reasons for what they do.”

Cialdini cites a fascinating study where a participant would ask another person if they could use a copy machine. The participant would ask in three ways:

The results showed that when the request was accompanied by a reason, even a redundant one like “because I have to make copies” (which doesn’t provide new information), compliance was significantly higher than when no reason was given!

The word “because” is magic! It makes people more likely to agree to a request.

Action Step:The next time you need to make a request, try out Cialdini’s method using a genuine reason. For instance, if you’re asking a colleague to help with a project, you might say, “Would you be willing to help with this report? Because I’d really appreciate your expertise.”

The tools of persuasion are powerful! And if you do choose to study them, remember that it’s always crucial to honor someone’s consent.

Listening is an art form. Listening well allows those around you to feel heard and understood. If you are a good listener, people will want to open up to you and share their vulnerability with you.

Being a great listener comes down to

If you listen well, it will create deeper relationships, and you will likely become a trusted confidant and a valued part of others’ support systems.

To take your listening one step further, you can focus on active listening. This is where you nod, say lots of affirmations like “yep” and “mmhmm,” and most importantly, you reflect back on what you heard and help the other person go deeper into what they shared.

Check out this masterful example of listening where Oprah uses reflective listening and lots of empathy to make Pharell come to tears and feel deeply understood.

Action Step:Ask a friend if you can practice your listening with them! Put on a timer for 5 minutes, and ask them to share what’s going on in their life. Any time they pause in their share, your job is to reflect back on what they’ve heard so far.

This activity will help you practice understanding what the other person is saying.

If you struggle with listening, you could also consider avow of silencefor a few hours or a few days where you are forced to listen.

To be magnetic is to ooze out charisma in a way where people want nothing more than to be in your presence!

Magnetic people are usuallyapproachableand easy to like.

The social skill of magnetism has to do with:

One great way to become more magnetic is to focus on your positive energy. You don’t want to veer intotoxic positivity,but if you can be genuinely positive, it’s infectious to be around.

Here are a few ideas.

Action Step:In your next interaction, try one of the following to be more positive:

A good storyteller always seems to enrapture others in intriguing stories. If you’re good at storytelling, then others will fall into a trance when listening to your tales, completely immersed in what happened.

Storytelling helps you entertain others, move and inspire them, and create shared moments of connection. A story can change the energy of an entire room and bring people into a collective imagination space. Powerful stuff. There’s a reason that storytelling is as old as human culture4https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/storytelling-and-cultural-traditions/.

Here are the key aspects of a well-told story:

Nurturing is a social skill where you take care of others, offer support, and show warmth. It’s often an expression of a parental instinct, and this social skill can sometimes also come out as the impulse to protect those whom you love.

The core of being a nurturer lies in your unwavering concern for the well-being of others.

If you are a natural nurturer or want to expand your nurturing skillset, be careful because it can be easy to extend into a few pitfalls, including:

The best way to become a better nurturer is to practice opening your heart. If you start to put your awareness on when others feel upset, hurt, or stifled, you can cultivate the impulse in yourself to support and nurture.

Action Step:The next time you are in a social interaction, see if you can make a game of noticing when the other person expresses pain or discomfort. That’s the first step! Just being more aware. If you want to take it to the next step, make an effort to help or support your friend in that moment.

The ability to read people refers to the skillset of decoding another person’s body language, word choice, and emotional expression to understand what they are feeling underneath the surface.

It is a type ofemotional intelligenceand comes down to your ability to perceive. To practice reading people can also feel like detective work, where you are searching for clues.

This is a valuable skill because most people aren’t open to books that will tell you exactly how they’re feeling and what they’re thinking at a given moment. And in fact, most people don’t even know themselves! So, if you can figure out what people are feeling and subconsciously conveying around you, it gives you extra information to navigate social situations skillfully and gracefully.

To get better at reading people, the main clues to pay attention to are:

If you’d like to improve your ability to read people, one of the best places to start is by reading microexpressions on faces. Here isan awesome guideto show you how to do just that.

Leadership is a powerful social skill that can help bring a group together. Folks who are good leaders empower others, provide an inspiring vision that others want to follow, and give direction to a group.

Imagine you’re with a group of friends, and everyone is bored, hanging out on the couch, turning into lumps. A person with leadership skills might notice the group energy slumping and compellingly propose that everyone mobilizes to eat together.

In this simple example above, a good leader has:

Leadership can be scary for many people because it requires making decisions and taking charge.

But not every leader needs to be super assertive and directorial. There arelots of styles of leadership!

If you’d like to build this skill, check out this article:How to Be a Great Leader: 16 Science-Backed Skills.

Action Step:If you have an experimental friend, try this! Go on an adventure together, where you each act as the leader for an hour. When it’s your turn, you’ll steer the charge of what you do together—whether walking into shops or sipping hot drinks at a café.

And remember, a good leader doesn’t just command people around; they get a sense of what the rest of the group wants! Afterward, reflect and give each other feedback.

This is a social skill that allows you to build relationships with influential people and develop a large network of colleagues whom you can call on for support when you need to get things done.

It’s also a skill that helps you connect other people with each other.

Some of the main components of networking are:

As with many social skills, networking can have a shadow side. If you get too focused on networking, you can start to see people more for their function than their humanity. So, if you want to build this skill, it’s important to balance it with empathy, generosity, and a genuine desire to connect.

Just like the animals who can change their color, the social skill of chameleoning allows you to change your vibe to match those around you.

It’s a skill that helps you get along with just about everyone.

As psychologistMark Snyderputs it, chameleons “read the nature of the situation, invoke an image of the type of person the situation calls for, and then use the image as a guide to their own behavior.”

In social settings, a chameleon might seamlessly float from one group to another and be seen as friends with everyone.

This skill requires you to be flexible and adaptive to your social environment. Some researchers5https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1025389814290would say you must actively observe social roles and contextual cues and subconsciously mimic the mannerisms, postures, and behaviors of the people you interact with.

To be a good chameleon, you might also want to step back and scrutinize a social situation before jumping in. That way, you can understand the energy and norms to adapt to.

If you try to chameleon, but you feel that your behaviors are not having the intended effect, you can continue to change and adapt until you hit the right note. As a consequence, you’ll be welcomed by and integrated into many different social groupings.

Many people who are chameleons also struggle withpeople-pleasingand can lose track of their own preferences, personality, and identity because they spend so much time watching others. It can also be emotionally draining to constantly exit one’s own “vibe” to match another person’s.

Action Step:To practice this skill, the next time you are at a party or social event, make an effort to match the energy of each new person you talk to instead of leading with your own energy.

One powerful skill is being a linchpin, where you are the glue that holds a group in one piece, and you bring different people together6https://www.routledge.com/Relationship-Management-and-the-Management-of-Projects-1st-Edition/Smyth/p/book/9780415705127.

Bringing people together is a valuable social skill because it puts you in the center of a social web, which increases your status and social power. It also builds community and helps others make new connections.

The biggest skills required to bring people together are taking the initiative and envisioning who might mesh well with whom.

Most people don’t take social initiative. They wait to get invited to plans. So, if you are the one who makes the plans and invites people, then you’ll be viewed as a social leader and can help others feel included.

Single Action Step:Start by organizing a small event or gathering for a group. This could be as simple as inviting two people to meet for a drink. Or bringing a group of people together for a drawing meetup.

Teaching social skills often involves modeling positive interactions and providing opportunities for practice in various settings. Role-playing, guided discussions, and social games can be particularly effective tools.

Social media can both enhance and hinder social skills; it offers a platform for connection and self-expression but may reduce face-to-face interactions and the development of empathy and emotional cues. It’s all about balance and mindful usage.

Developing good social skills in students requires creating an environment where they can practice empathy, teamwork, and effective communication regularly. Encouraging group projects and structured social activities can be very beneficial.

Homeschooling can affect social skills differently depending on the individual and their level of engagement with varied social settings outside the home. It can help to proactively involve preschoolers, young children, and older kids in community activities, and group learning can help mitigate any potential deficits.

To improve social skills as a teenager, actively seek out diverse social interactions and reflect on your experiences. Joining clubs, sports, or other group activities can provide valuable practice and feedback.

If you feel your social skills are lacking, it might be due to limited practice,anxiety, or not learning these skills early on. Don’t worry, though; social skills can be improved in adulthood through mindful practice and learning.

Examples of social skills include humor, listening, empathy, leadership, and the ability to read social cues. These skills are crucial for building and maintaining relationships with family members, workplace peers, employees, and friends.

Remember, here are the top social skills to learn:

What are social skills?

The benefits of having good social skills

How can I enhance my social skills?

Do I have trouble with social skills?

The bottom line

We all have moments where our social skills fail us. Perhaps your joke was greeted with awkward silence. Or, at a restaurant, you enthusiastically told the waiter that they, too, should enjoy their meal.

The odd mishap with friends is hardly cause for alarm. The embarrassment will soon transform into aninside joke, deeping your bond with others.

But, if you fumble too often, it can take a toll onyour self-esteemandmental health. If you don't know how to improve your social skills, it can hold you back socially and at work. Some behaviors can come across as antisocial or even harmful to others, while simple shyness can read as aloof,standoffish, or arrogant. Knowing this might not put you at ease, but it can help you understand other people's reactions.

Now that companies are starting to pull teams together in person, many people are feeling some level of social anxiety. Just because it feels uncomfortable, not feeling confident in your ability to spend more than 5 minutes chatting with coworkers isn't an option. The good news? The past two years haven't helped anyone feel socially smooth. Many people are feeling awkward. The bad news? Many people are behaving awkwardly, and misunderstandings will happen.

You don’t have to change yourself. But you might have to change your approach, not just to appear more sociable but to avoid the most unnecessary points of friction that undermine your confidence. This will not only improve how others perceive you, but it can also benefit you in other ways.

If you’ve been feeling out of place, developing your social skills can help you feel more at home with your colleagues. It can also improve your confidence, sense of belonging, and ability to collaborate at work — all important skills that will affect your mental health, motivation, and ability to succeed.

Training your social skills can be difficult. But we know you can do it.

Here’show to improve social skillsat work, with strangers, and in every other part of your life.

Social skills are the verbal andnonverbal communication skillsrequired to foster connections and appropriately navigate social settings. Think about socializing a puppy: The more interaction it has with other puppies when it’s young, the better it knows how to act when it’s older. Humans are similar.

Most of the time, when people think of “social skills,” they think of their everyday interactions. It’s how they gain acceptance from their colleagues or peers and involves being comfortable when speaking to strangers,easily making friends, and earning the respect of your co-workers.

These things don’t always come naturally. Individuals withsocial anxiety, for example, might have trouble connecting with others. Introverts orshy peoplewho like to keep to themselves may actively avoid social interactions — and appear rude as a result. Or, sometimes, we get uncomfortable around people we don’t know and lose some of our social confidence.

No matter the case, it’s nice to have some basic principles to fall back on. Knowing how to develop your social skills will help you in the long run.

So what’s in it foryou? Well, a lot. Improving your social skills is essential for yoursocial healthand overall well-being.

In terms of mental health, people with strong social tieshave lower rates of anxiety and depression. They also have higher self-esteem, greater empathy, and are more cooperative.

For your physical health, researchers knewas early as 1988that lack of social connection is more harmful than obesity, smoking, and high blood pressure. And, more recently, they learned that isolation is associated with a50% increased risk of dementiaas you age.

Sharpening your social skills will also pay you back in the form ofsocial capital. Entire university programs are devoted to studying this concept. But, to keep it simple, we can define social capital as the sum of all benefits from being part of a social group.

Social capital comes with its own list of benefits:

In today’s gig economy, social capital is critical. It can earn you a higher salary, win you more interesting projects, and may be the deciding factor in your next job application. Consider working witha BetterUp coachto improve this area of your career.

We’re glad you asked! You can definitely learn or improve your social life. Here are some general guidelines to get you started:

Put yourself in their shoes. Imagine what they might be going through and try to understand their feelings. You’ll better understand their perspective, which will help you respond appropriately.

Pay attention to your emotions, thoughts, behaviors, and triggers. Then it will be easier to control them while interacting with others.

Use tactics like active listening and open body language to demonstrate attentiveness. This opens the door to more positive interactions.

Try acting like your more social peers, even if it’s just small talk. It will become easier every time you try it.

You don’t have to worry about speaking up; askopen-ended questionsand use active listening. People love talking about themselves.

Everyone likes a good compliment. Tell someone that they were great in that meeting, or their project was top-notch. Be specific.

Good manners go a long way. Words like “please” and “thank you” are small but powerful ways to soften requests.

Face the person with whom you’re speaking. Pay attention to your tone of voice. Make eye contact. Use yourbody languageto show you’re present and paying attention.

So many conversations revolve around current events; try to keep up so you can chime in.

It’s okay to feel a little anxious, but don’t let it get the best of you. You’re not your thoughts.Take a deep breathand try to let them go; this will help you relax in a social situation.

Start by spending time in a coffee shop or practicing your conversation skills with family members. Then you can ease into larger social settings. Before you know it, you'll be making new friends at your next social gathering.

A lot ofpeople with anxietyor ADHD have a hard time connecting with others. Introverts or very shy people may also struggle.

Here are some signs that you don't have great social skills:

It’s normal to experience awkward moments. You might tell the theatre employee to enjoy a movie they’re not going to see or tell a joke that no one laughs at. It happens; cut yourself some slack.

But poor social skills go beyond the occasional blunder. At best, you seem aloof. At worst, outright rude. It’s good to evaluate your social skills and see which ones you can improve to be your best self.

That’s not to say that you canlearn to overcome shynessor that you have to be a social butterfly. But it’s nice to know that when youwantto strike up a conversation — whether inside or out of work — you’ll feel comfortable doing so.

If you need help,BetterUp is here. We’ll give you the tools you need to learn how to improve your social skills to ease your social discomfort or learn better communication skills. Whatever your best self needs, we can help you find.

While professional pursuits give life purpose, moments of shared laughter, joy, and camaraderie remind us that we matter beyond our achievements, successes, and social standing. Awell-nurtured friendshipacts like a buffer against the uncertainty of life, and the comforting presence of friends becomes our emotional anchor, safeguarding our emotional health and well-being.

The longeststudyon adult life has confirmed the same. The data gathered over 85 years revealed that good relationships were the strongest predictor of lasting health and happiness.

As daunting as it may seem to step outside one’s comfort zone and interact with new people, it is an undertaking with enough benefits to be worth the effort it demands.

Self-acceptance allows us to acknowledge our strengths and limitations withoutfeeling flawed or lacking.

"Accept and embrace your personality traits, strengths, and weaknesses. If you areintrovertedor shy, don't try to change yourself or pretend to be someone else. Instead, acknowledge your preferences and needs and find ways to balance them with social situations,” advises psychologistKetan Parmar, M.D., MBBS.

Self-acceptance creates an inner assurance that diminishes the fear of external judgment, and once we stop seeking approval, we can be ourselves and focus solely on forging genuine connections. Such confidence and authenticity appeal to others, inviting them to engage more openly and honestly, leading to stress-free, meaningful, and enjoyable interactions.

By embracing our authentic selves, we attract those who appreciate us as we are, creating a positive feedback loop that further boosts our self-image. It adds to our social confidence, enhancing social experiences and connections.

Broaden your social circle by accepting the invites you receive. Even if the invite is for something new and unfamiliar, don't let the fear of not fitting in hold you back; Focus on finding a new friend or even just initiating a connection with someone new.

Licensed psychotherapist and chief clinical officer atD'Amore Mental Health,Gary Tuckersuggests that, regardless of the event itself, to expand your social network, one must make an effort to attend social gatherings. “These events allow you to meet new people and broaden your social circle,” he explains.

If you are genuinely invested infinding new friends, establishing some regularity to your social outings is necessary, but don't agree to unappealing activities. Each accepted invitation will inform others of your interest in and availability for social gatherings, encouraging them to invite you to more events.

You will find yourself in unfamiliar territories in your journey to be more socially active. The trick is to balance out the discomfort of the unknown with something known and pleasurable. For instance, if you’re meeting someone new, arrange your time together to be in a place you love. If you are trying something new, do it with someone you already know and like.

The desire for connection shouldn’t drive us to do things that feel persistently unpleasant. Such an approach is never sustainable. There are many ways to be more social—pick one that doesn’t place you under unnecessary stress.

“Recognize and understand your own social comfort zones and boundaries. It begins with an internal journey of acknowledging your fears and anxieties and working towards overcoming them,”Bayu Prihandito, certified psychology expert and life coach tells mindbodygreen.

Research1published in theJournal of Social and Personal Relationshipshas found that for two people to becomecasual friends, it takes roughly 50 hours spent together. Transitioning to close friendship takes 90 hours, and becoming very close friends requires 200 hours of quality time together.

You can use this knowledge tostrengthen your bondwith those you already know and, in doing so, create a supportive circle of friends and enhance your social life without the pressure of meeting new people.

"Sometimes, it's not about making new friends but rekindling old ones," reminds licensed marriage and family therapistMichelle Landeros, LMFT.

Astudy2showed that while volunteering is good for mental health, the benefits stem from the social connectedness that volunteering promotes. As Prihandito says, “Volunteering not only contributes to your personal growth and sense of accomplishment, but it also opens new ways to connect with others.”

It creates an environment conducive to teamwork, communication, and empathy. With little effort, you become part of a diverse community that brings together members of different ages, backgrounds, and life experiences. Regular volunteer work can lead to frequent social interactions with people who share your values and interests, making your social life more vibrant and fulfilling.

Start looking at strangers as potential friends. Be it in a supermarket, the yoga studio, or the salon, engage in light-hearted conversations with the people around you. A positive response will add to your confidence, and if the exchange leads to a connection, it will add to your social circle. Soon, you will be surrounded by familiar faces wherever you go, giving you a profound sense of belonging and community.

"Make the first move. Don't wait for others to approach you or invite you. Instead, initiate conversations, ask questions, offer compliments, or suggest plans," Parmar suggests.

Dive into the deep end of the social pool by hosting an event. It's demanding work, but the control remains with you. As the host, you control the environment, the guest list, and even, to some extent, the flow of the conversation. It’s the ideal setting to reconnect with old friends, make new connections, and solidify existing bonds.

The role of a host also puts you in the spotlight, boosting your confidence, enhancing your social skills, and attracting attention that can result in reciprocal invitations.

As long as you're cautious of your safety and conscious of your boundaries, social media platforms can provide an easy way to socialize with individuals worldwide. According to areportpublished by Pew Research Center, online engagement, like participating in interest-based groups and discussion forums, can lead to real-life friendships.

When interacting online, we can be as visible as we desire, allowing us to release the insecurities of face-to-face interactions. We can exchange ideas, share past life experiences, and even advocate for causes that matter to us. Such interactions lead to social bonds grounded in mutual understanding and support. Moreover, online groups are usually very diverse, further enriching our social life.

Landeros recommends collaborative online gaming to be more social. According to her, online multiplayer games, especially role-playing ones, require teamwork and communication. They help you understand social dynamics. “It's a modern way to engage with others and improve collaborative skills,” she tells mindbodygreen.

Seek new friends in an environment designed to engage and promote the exchange of ideas. Joining a class is the easiest way to be more social. Interact with fellow students before class starts, during breaks, and share pleasure in the knowledge gained at the end of each class and continue the discussion over coffee.

What starts with an exchange of ideas can lead to other mutually enjoyable activities, and intellectual bonds can graduate to deeper emotional connections.

According to mental health physician and professorRyan Sultan M.D., you can use the opportunity to find people who share your interests. “Take the initiative to start conversations and make plans with others," he adds. Learning in most classrooms is collaborative; It allows for easy communication, fostering a sense of camaraderie and bonding among participants.

A class is also a regular event, giving you the time to ease into new connections and cement friendships and bonds over a period of time.

Joining a club is better if you prefer something less formal and more free-flowing. “Participate in community groups or clubs that are aligned with your interests. It’s a natural setting to meet like-minded people,” says Prihandito.

You can join a club or group dedicated to an old hobby so that joining in feels easy. Joining a sports team, adventure group, or an activist group interested in creating can also be helpful.

You can also develop a new hobby as you try to find new friendships. Join a club dedicated to an activity that you’ve never done before. It will invite you to show up differently and add freshness to your interactions.

Ask your friends, siblings, spouse, and other family members to introduce you to their friends and social network. Join them on outings with their friends and use them as a go-between with people you identify as kindred spirits.

When they get invited to an event, consider accompanying them as their plus one. Attend networking events and finagle an introduction to people they may know and who interest you.

Carpooling with current friends is another option that can allow you to meet new people. When you organize a meet-up, ask your friends to bring one of their (non-mutual) friends along so everyone’s social circle can grow and there is a new energy in the group.

And when you meet a new connection, be open and approachable. Don’t hesitate to ask for contact details if you feel a connection. Keep the conversation going without being pushy or overstepping your bounds.

Whenever something is even a little complicated, our brain, wired to seek comfort, will do everything to avoid it. So, Parmar recommends, “Set realistic and specific goals for yourself,” and decide on a strategy as well.

“Instead of saying I want to be more social, say I want to talk to one new person at the party or join a book club that meets once a month. This way, you can measure your progress,” he adds.

There are many ways to be social; clarity around your goals will allow you to pick the best path. If you are seeking intellectual connections, socialize more with professionals. If you want deeper emotional bonds, attend classes, hobby groups, or discussion forums to bond with others over shared experiences and ideas.

Astudy3published in the journalPLOS ONEfound that sensitivity to and fear of rejection can negatively impact our ability and willingness to socialize.

Individuals fearful of rejection are reluctant to initiate social contact, start conversations, or express interest in others. Learn to view rejection as a regular part of human interaction, not a statement of your worth.

Gracefully handling rejection can enhance social resilience and willingness to socialize even without any positive validation. On encountering a negative social response, you bounce back quickly, tweak your approach, and try again with someone new. This attitude allows for healthier, happier, and more frequent social engagements, leading to a more robust social network.

As you step away from your comfort zone, wade into new territories, and engage in more social experiences, you are bound to feel some degree of exhaustion. To continue with your adventures, you must regularly replenish your energy reserves.

“This could include scheduling time to recharge, attending smaller and more intimate gatherings, or participating in activities relevant to their interests,” Tucker notes.

Regular self-care will keep your stress levels in check, help you maintain a healthy emotional state, and allow you to be fully present in your interactions and engage positively with others. So, as you focus on being more socially available, try bringing your best self to each new social engagement.

We communicate without words using facial expressions, hand gestures, mannerisms, and tone. Using open and positive body language puts others at ease, invites trust, and conveys openness and receptivity. When we correctlyinterpret social cues, we can appropriately adjust our response and communication strategies to prevent misunderstandings and project interest and empathy.

When speaking with someone, making eye contact establishes a connection, projects confidence, and shows interest. By looking someone in the eye, you also show that you’ve nothing to hide. It adds to your persuasiveness.

Indicate deep interest by allowing others to speak freely without interruptions. Ask thoughtful questions that encourage them to continue sharing. Suchactive listeningcreates a feeling of being understood and valued, forging a stronger bond and companionship with the listener.

A smile is the universal language of positivity and approachability, and happy people are also naturally attractive. Smile to put people at ease and create a vibe of friendliness so the conversation flows more easily..

As it is the prelude to deeper, more meaningful conversation, handle small talk with style and finesse. It’s an unavoidable part of social interactions, and if done well, it can be the first step towards a new friendship.

Let curiosity lead in a conversation and ask open-ended questions. You can make someone feel important and interesting by asking thoughtful questions and showing a genuine interest in their life. This approach endears us to others and makes us desirable companions for social outings.

Learn to introduce yourself with style and enough context to kickstart further conversation. Establish yourself as friendly but confident from the outset.

By honoring someone’s boundaries, you show consideration for their comfort and preferences. It creates trust and positions you as sensitive and willing to make a non-confrontational and relaxed environment for your companions.

First meetings can be awkward; To dispel those awkward silences, useconversation startersand initiate discussions around popular topics that interest most people. These tools can facilitate smoother interactions and give you the confidence to go into a roomful of strangers and engage them in captivating conversations on diverse topics.

Role-playing can be helpful if you struggle to be present and confident during social gatherings. Mentally place yourself in different social scenarios and rehearse your responses. It is a risk-free way for shy individuals tohone their social skillswithout engaging in social encounters.

Ask others for feedback on how you interact and perform socially, and use that feedback to improve your social skills further.

The only way to forge a connection is through understanding and respect. Maintaining an open mind when socializing is necessary to avoid conflict and appreciate others’ perspectives.Empathyallows you to tune into their feelings and respond in a way that makes them feel included and valued.

It makes people feel acknowledged and personalize your interactions. It creates a sense of familiarity and adds warmth to even a new connection.

A compliment is an effective ice-breaker. It also makes people feel good about themselves and draws them to you as the source of that feeling. Make your compliments specific so they are more personal to the receiver.

Improving social skills takes work and practice. For tangible improvement, seize every opportunity to socialize and consciously apply the recommended strategies. Over time, your ability to communicate and connect with others will improve, and you will become a much-desired companion with a rich social life.

Apart from practical considerations like time, budget, and location, the degree to which someone socializes can depend on a blend of psychological, biological, and environmental influences.

Children raised in environments where open communication and social interactions are encouraged tend to grow into socially confident adults. Conversely, those who experience a lot of isolation, criticism, and repression in their childhood may find socializing challenging.

During adulthood, an individual's social performance and the positive or negative response it elicits can also impact social inclinations. People with many positive social interactions in their past comfortably move through society, while those who have faced a lot ofrejectionstruggle with it. Someone's emotional and cognitive intelligence level may also impact their social behavior.

Individuals identified as extroverts are naturally keen on and thrive in social settings, while introverts prefer a quiet and solitary life. Prihandito shares that for extroverts,social interactions are energizing. “They thrive in group settings and are often seen as outgoing and expressive,” he adds.

Introverts, on the other hand, find excessive social engagement may be draining. They're in tune with their inner world and disconnect and retreat within whenever they need to refuel. Introverts prefer intimate groups and deep, meaningful conversations to small talk in large gatherings. It doesn't necessarily mean they don't enjoy socializing—they simply like their experiences in different shades to what extroverts like.

In 2011, oneconference paperdivided introversion intofour main types: social, thinking, anxious, and restrained introvert. The distinction was made based on how different introverts respond to social invitations, handle interpersonal interactions, and how they recharge their batteries.

Hans Eysenck's influential "Big Three" model4shared that introverts have higher baseline brain activity, are more sensitive to stimulation, and can easily reach sensory overload in a noisy, crowded environment.

According to Carl Jung, the distinction is more about an individual's world orientation. Extroverts, as the term suggests, are more oriented towards the external world, while introverts focus more on their internal world and use their thoughts and emotions as energy sources.The Big Five Personality Traits (OCEAN)proposed that the behavioral manifestation of these traits is due to the interplay of various factors, including genetic predispositions, environment, upbringing, and even life experiences.

The important point is that regardless of where you fall on the spectrum, you can have a rich social life as long as you socialize in a way that plays well with your individual preferences, needs, and boundaries. More importantly, as Landeros points out, it's a spectrum, not a dichotomy, and it’s okay, even healthy, for introverts to maintain a few deep, intimate relationships over a vast social network.

Introverts should increase their social interactions in small, manageable steps. They can meet new people through mutual friends, which can be less stressful. They can join online groups and forums. Instead of making many new friends, introverts should focus on cultivating a few deep, meaningful friendships.

As with most skills, practice can help you improve your social performance. Start by engaging in more social interactions. Seek opportunities to practice your communication skills and interpersonal dynamics in a structured setting. If necessary, join local groups, clubs, or classes. Ask for constructive feedback and take action on what you learn. Find someone with notable social success; observe them and try to emulate their style.

From limited emotional intelligence to developmental disorders, there can be various reasons for someone lacking good social skills. Social anxiety can lead to inhibited and jerky social interactions, while an inability to read social cues can make it challenging to establish empathetic, meaningful connections with others. Past rejections or social failures can be another culprit.

Inherent personality traits, social anxiety, developmental conditions, a repressive childhood, and even past rejections can be any number of reasons for someone's lack of sociability. It can also be as benign as a lack of opportunities to socialize or not finding like-minded friends with shared interests. Friendliness is subjective and depends on an individual's preferences, interests, energy, and comfort levels.

The people in our lives act as buffers against mental distress, enhancing our overall health and wellbeing and encouraging our growth. By socializing actively, you can create astrong network of support, love, and guidance.

Choose methods that play well with your preferences, energy levels, and boundaries to formnew connectionsanddeepen the existing ones. If socializing ischallengingfor you, take time to reflect. Self-explore to identify if you lack specific interpersonal skills, have chosen the wrong crowd, or need a little guidance.

Your inner and outer world will become immeasurably richer as your social circle expands. With each new friendship that blossoms, you will appreciate the value of being cherished and understood in a space you’ve cultivated with care and sincerity.

Transcript:
(00:01) something that I've been working on is control and the urge to want to control everything um hang with me I've been having a hard time I'm going to be honest and I don't know if it's like the time of year or if it's because we're out of covid now although people are saying we're going back into it I don't know what it is but everybody I've talked to friends family people in our community it seems like we mainly me are in a time of transition my sister-in-law was visiting and she
(00:32) said I feel like we're all in a joined identity crisis or crisis of identities actually how she said it and I actually like that wording because I think that's kind of what I've been going through is like who am I now what am I doing now I've been feeling like I want to change things up whether it's like through the videos and what I do online or you know like I'm not really feeling connected here in Austin and I've been talking to Sean and like my therapist and my friends about it and
(01:00) like how do I bring that about like I'm still trying I'm still reaching out I'm still trying to spend time with people in the area trying to find you know that connection that I feel like is part of who I am or what I'm about and it's just been exhausting and difficult and I don't know I'd love to hear from you guys in the comments but I feel like a lot of people are going through something similar which is why I want to talk about it here because you can tell it's still very fresh for me so sorry
(01:30) um you know I'm a crier it's just how I express myself but it just feels even my therapist said I feel like this is like a time of internal work for a lot of people and I think she's right and some of my friends who have kids are like oh I think it's because it's like a new school year it feels like a brand new start so they've been kind of going out feeling like okay well now that the kids are back in a schedule what do I want to do with my time what do I want to accomplish this year feeling like it's
(01:56) almost like the start of a new year right and I know that there is something to that but I feel like it's bigger than that I feel like in with my friends and family we've had like a lot of just big shifts whether it's people moving long distances we have people in our life going through divorce I have friends who've lost you know like parents and important family members it's just been like really tumultuous feeling and um trying to figure out who we want to be now or who I want to be now what is
(02:25) it that I'm passionate about like it's been really hard I think something that I've been working on is control and the urge to want to control everything um hang with me um I am kind of a control freak but I'm working on just like the people pleasing and I'll talk about how I think that's connected but something I've been noticing is there's a lot of stuff that I'd like to do more of like I would love to do more speaking engagements I love meeting people in real in person I think probably because
(02:56) kovid like starved us of that I love to meet people in person I love to hug them I love to see things resonate on people's faces when I'm talking about something that I'm passionate about that's like there's nothing more fulfilling to me and so I think you know that would bring me a lot more joy and be much more fulfilling for me in my job however you know people have to book me to come speak this is not a plea for that it's just being honest um people would have to book it for me to be able to do that for that to become
(03:27) more of my life so I don't really have control over that coming to fruition right I can like work as hard as I want to work but it's not going to change it and that's left me feeling like without a sense of control and that's really really triggering for me and I was talking to my therapist because I don't really like using the word triggered so I just say it's dysregulating and that took me down a path of like what role is control in my life and why is it so upsetting when I don't feel
(03:55) like I have it and I always thought oh it's you know I need control because my dad worked away from home a lot when I was growing up and it felt very out of control to me I wanted him to be at all of my events and I thought as a kid that if I like worked hard enough and did everything just right then he would want to show up I mean he was working it wasn't like he was choosing to not be at home but you know kid brain right I didn't understand I didn't understand that and so I thought oh if I just do everything right
(04:25) and just perfect then he'll show up for me and that wasn't in my control obviously as it wasn't really even in his control it was more like where his boss sends him he has to go right and so as I got older I found that like things being inconsistent or people not showing up for me when they say they're going to is like oh it's really dysregulating and so as a way to kind of alleviate that I try to be a control freak and a people pleaser because that would mean that then I always thought that then you know I'm
(04:59) trying to make things feel calmer for me I'm trying to ensure that people show up for me because I have pleased them right they like me they'll show up for me their approval is incredibly important and it led me down this path of thinking that oh my control freakiness and my people pleasing urges or because my childhood felt very inconsistent and I'm trying to bring consistency to my life it kind of made sense and for years I've been in therapy and felt like like it fits but it only fits like I don't know like 30 percent I feel
(05:28) like there's something missing and this is why I've been encouraging all of you to journal for years and I know you hate it but I'm just gonna say it again but journaling through my journaling one morning I was just posing questions I was like why is it that I that this is so triggering why is it that I feel like I need to control and ends up pushing people away BTW it's not actually effective um why do I do that and I hate that I do I don't even like that part of myself you know I'm like thinking and asking
(05:54) myself questions and all of a sudden I'm hit with this realization it's not about the people pleasing it's not about control it's actually about me proving my worth so hang in there I'll try to explain it to you hopefully it makes sense by controlling situations because controlling it's not me saying someone can or can't do something my control type of stuff is like trying to make everything just perfect and like controlling the environment and trying to make sure that everybody's having a
(06:28) good time like if Sean and I threw a party I'd be like are you did you need a drink I like couldn't even enjoy myself because I'm so worried about everybody else it's kind of control slash people pleasing right they kind of mishmash that was actually me like hustling for my worth like feeling like I had to earn people's attention or proving that I was worth showing up for I'm still processing it but it's very true so that covered like 30 and this covers like this other component right and I feel like there's
(07:10) just a lot of like processing for me to do in my own therapy in my own life because I do it here too I try to hustle to like prove that I'm important enough which is really sad and it's something that I like I I hated to admit I've been hearing from a lot of you recently the in therapy you've been feeling like oh I'm so embarrassed to share this or why do I want to lie why do I lie to my therapist and I was thinking about it I'm like because when you are honest with yourself when we show up for each other
(07:46) and when we're vulnerable and when we share things that are hard and that aren't fully processed or things that we try to pretend don't exist that's a risk it feels scary and we want to lie and we want to downplay it and we want to pretend it's not that big of a deal right minimize because if sometimes if we you know if I am honest and if I share like real stuff oh the vulnerability hangover right the like oh my God people are gonna judge there's gonna be talkers in the comments there's gonna be
(08:20) people at my work or family or life or whatever who are like I can't believe you did that that's so stupid and I think a lot of that is just what keeps us it's stuck and I think that that's kind of what's been going on if I could like hypothesize because um this kind of what am I doing who am I this crisis of identity for me I think it's coming out of the fact that I've just been like pretending I'm okay even though life has been really tumultuous for all of us like I'm not pretending that you know I'm not trying
(08:56) to compare or contrast anybody's anything it's been felt very chaotic it's felt very out of control it's been super triggering and it feels like right now things have finally not calmed down because I don't want to pretend that like things aren't still hard but like it's calmed down enough or maybe I've just reached capacity so that I can actually admit how hard it's been and I feel like maybe that's why we're in this like crisis of identity like who am I what am I doing
(09:26) um like my girlfriend Joanna and I are working on this book called live big so far I love it it's much easier to digest than the artist's way the artist's way is great but it's a lot of work and sometimes I don't have the bandwidth this book is like you read like two pages and that's your chapter and there's like five short exercises and in the exercise we were doing it asked us to Define Freedom like what does it mean to be free God that was a good exercise I encourage you to do it what does it mean to be
(09:53) free how do you define it and then it has you do what they call like a dirty dozen so it's like what are 12 things really quick you rattle off in order to be free I need to I want to I must and you just roll through this and 12 is a lot so it like forces you kind of out of your thinking brain and into your like emotion brain a little bit um and it was really really telling and it was really helpful for me to see where I was like locking myself up and anyways I was talking to my girlfriend about it Joanna I love her so
(10:25) much she's like no not best friends and she said you know that's going to be really hard because like I don't even know what I want and at this moment where I was like you know what I don't even know if we spend any time I don't know if I've spent any time considering what is I want more of like I said I want to speak more but am I doing is there anything else I can do to make that happen maybe there is are there other things what about things I want in my personal life I always focus
(10:54) on like work and accomplishments again hustling to prove that I'm worth showing up for oh so it's been it's been a total roller coaster but in a good way because sometimes I feel like if I if I just remain stagnant if I don't challenge myself if I'm not honest with you or myself most importantly myself about how I'm feeling and what I'm going through then I just feel more isolated almost like I'm like isolating myself even from myself like disconnection like I don't want to experience that that's
(11:28) uncomfortable but I do know that if I if I don't sit in the discomfort if I'm not honest and then it only feels worse and I know I'm not alone in this like I've talked to a bunch of people friends family and members of our community it just feels like we're just going through a weird maybe we're shedding the skin of our past selves I'd like to think that's what's happening I also just think that maybe it's just a time of transition maybe it's just a an assessment it's time for some
(12:01) internal work we've been doing or I personally been doing a lot of like external stuff keeping myself busy there's lots of work to do I'm working on a new book proposal I'm trying to give a TED talk I'm trying to make the videos more interesting for you guys I'm trying to work on myself doing my workbooks you know I'm just doing this stuff with people and things but the fact that you know I need to take a minute for me I need to figure out what it is that I actually want what am I happy about what am I unhappy about
(12:34) why am I not prioritizing that I don't want to take up any more of your time it's just that's just been what I've been going through it's hard I'm still processing it I just want all of you to know that even though it's uncomfortable and even though it's messy it looks messy it sounds messy it's okay we all go through those periods I don't have it all figured out I'm still learning about myself I'm still learning about how I want to be in this world what's appropriate what's not life
(13:03) is messy it's complicated it's hard and it's okay because we'll get through it right you're not alone if you've been feeling kind of some kind of way about this like who am I what do I want know that I'm going through it too but we'll figure it out I keep asking myself those questions and I'll share along the way if you like this kind of stuff sometimes I'm like oh I don't want to be like too much like it's not about me I want to be helpful for you um hustle it for my worth you catch that
(13:32) I caught that um but you know I'd love to check in see how we're doing are we continuing to work on ourselves and acknowledge where we're having a hard time because everybody has hard times even me just because I'm a therapist doesn't mean I have it together I'm in my own therapy right we got to work on our own things um yeah so if I've been seemed a little distant or a little different it's just because I'm I'm in it but a minute with you and I promise I'll always be honest
(14:01) about it um yeah that's really it thank you for listening I hope that that was at least helpful in some way maybe there's just a little nugget in there um but yeah if you want me to keep checking in on stuff like this I'm happy to do it but enjoy the rest of your day all done I didn't think I'd cry but I did and I sweated I really

You can be in a room full of people and still feel incredibly lonely. No one really sees you, hears what you’re trying to say, or understands what you’re going through. When you feel this way, what can you do?

People often think that loneliness and being alone are the same thing. But that’s not necessarily true. You can be on your own and have a great time, curled up on the couch with agood book, playing the piano or taking yourself on anartist date. If you’re introverted, you probably even needalone timeto recharge.

That’s why loneliness isn’t so much a state of solitude as it is aboutfeelingalone, while you crave human connection. That emptiness can be caused by having a limited social network, with little (close) family and friends to talk to and spend time with. But there’s a second kind of loneliness that’s often overlooked:emotional loneliness.

Emotional loneliness refers to the lack of deep, nurturing relationships with people. If that’s feeling when you really want to talk to someone, but there’s nobody you can call in the middle of the night. You may also experience emotional loneliness when you lose someone you love or go through a divorce.

The problem is, when you’re chronically ill, you’re at risk of both kinds of loneliness. If you spend a lot of time sick in bed or resting at home, you can become socially isolated or have friendships fall apart. I’ve written before about how you canstrengthen your support systemandmake new friends with chronic illness. But even if you do have close relationships, it may still feel like your life is so different now, that nobody really understands your pain, worries and rollercoaster of emotions.

How do you deal with that hollow, aching feeling inside? I don’t have all the answers, buthere are some ideas to deal with emotional loneliness.

If you have caring friends and family in your life, have you given them a chance to really grasp your situation? Maybe you’ve only been hinting about your problems, but so subtly that your loved ones didn’t pick it up. Or perhaps you’ve mistakenventing for sharingyour problems.

To stop feeling so lonely, work out ways you can share your struggles in a clear and constructive manner.Putting your bottled up feelings into wordscan reduce the intensity of your sadness, anger and frustration over time – but only if you do it ‘right’. Of course there’s no one way totalk bout hard things, but here are some pointers:

Pick a person you trust and who’s willing to listen. Choose a timing and setting where there’s room for heart-to-heart conversations. Start by saying you want to share something you’re struggling with. Sometimes it helps to be clear upfront of what you need:“Don’t worry, you don’t have to come up with solutions for me, it would just be such a relief to get this off my chest. Would you lend a listening ear?”That way, expectations are clear, and you don’t get interrupted with well-meaning advice but still don’t feel heard.

When you can’t find the right words to say, maybe you can find abookor movie who does the explaining for you? Or perhaps you could get educated about your problem together?

Just remember one thing: if your conversation doesn’t turn out as you’d hoped, don’t get discouraged or rejected. Sometimes things take time to sink in. What’s more, it’s just one person, not the entire world. There’s always someone who cares and gets it. Which bring me to my next point…

Got nobody to turn to? It may feel like you’re all alone, no one who could possible understand the pain you’re going through. But somewhere in the world, there are others who are struggling with their chronic illness, mental health, sexual orientation or beliefs just like you.

Support groups and online communities can be a great way to get started. For example,The Mightyis a supportive community for people facing health challenges, whilePatientsLikeMehelps members to get answers, take charge of their health and heal together. You can find a starter list of patient communitieshere, but don’t hesitate to ask your doctor about local, in-person initiatives for your condition.

Although talking about your problems proves to be helpful, it’s tempting to keep focusing on the problem you have in common. But narrowing down on the negatives only causes more distress. Sodon’t identify too much with ‘labels‘ – you are more than your problems.

And as always, be mindful about who you share personal and confidential details with, especially online.

So you have a hard time explaining how you feel in conversations. That doesn’t have to stop you from expressing your emotions. Writing, for example, gives you time to gather and compose your thoughts, whereas painting and making collages helps you articulate feelings you can’t put into words. You could also make a playlist that reflects what you’re going through and process your sadness through songs.

Creatively expressing yourself throughjournaling, drawing, singing or intuitive dancing can provide some much-needed emotional release. And who knows, maybe reading your words or seeing your drawings helps others to get an idea of what you’re going through too.

When you’re struggling with emotional loneliness, you can always turn to books, movies and music. Some of the most beautiful works of art have come from heartache and suffering, showing you you are not alone.

Emotional loneliness gives you an empty feeling inside, that weighs you down. Andbeing socially excluded hurts – literally. It’s no wonder that lasting loneliness puts you at risk for depression. That’s why it’s important to pay attention to your internal dialogue.

Because if in your mind, you keep going over all the times that people have let you down or how lonely you are, that will only make you feel worse. You don’t have to ignore your sadness, but watch out for creatingautomatic negative thinking patterns.

Don’t overgeneralize. When one person makes insensitive remarks, that doesn’t mean that nobody understands you. Also don’t take everything personally. Most of the time, peoples choices have little to do with you and more with (a lack of) time, money and energy. Finally, don’t compare your life to others. What you see on Instagram is a highlight reel, not the full picture. If you’re prone tosocial media envy, do yourself a favor and stop watching those carefully curated snapshots.

Instead of engaging in negative self-talk, try to keep your mindpositively distractedduring lonely moments. Do crossword puzzles, create a mood board or bake a cake – whatever entertains you!

Don’t give up connecting with people because no one seems to truly understand your situation. The more you retreat, the less included you will feel, and the harder it will be to find someone who you can confide in.

Of course you don’t want hurtful or one-way street relationships. But if you’re blessed with relatives, old friends or former colleagues who try to stay in touch, even if it’s not on the level you’d like, don’t turn them down. Keep reaching out to the kind people in your life in big or small ways.

When it comes to reaching out, also considering talking to a doctor, therapist or social worker about your emotional loneliness. They are there to help. Please be aware of thewarning signs of depression.

And even though it doesn’t always feel that way, remember: You are not alone.

‘The irony of loneliness is we all feel it at the same time – together.’ – Rupi Kaur

The world can be a lonely place when you feel as though no one understands you.

It’s not like your ideas or behavior arethatoutlandish.

They just don’t conform to how everyone else thinks and acts.

You like different things.

The way you see the world is unique.

Because of that, you feel like a square peg in a round hole everywhere you go.

Perhaps even amongst your family and friends,you don’t feel as if you entirely belong.

You stick out like a sore thumb whenever you get together.

To avoid the inevitable eye rolls, blank stares, or “Huh?” you nod in agreement and stay silent, pretending to agree.

If you were to voice your opinion, they’d only pretend to understand what you’re saying.

They wouldn’t get it, or you.

Feeling this way can be a real burden, leading to isolation from friends, family members, and other support systems.

You start tofeel disconnected from everyone.

And when that happens, depression and other mental health challenges are sure to follow.

Sound familiar?

Keep reading to discover some of the reasons people might not ‘get’ you, and importantly, what you can do about it.

Speak to an accredited and experienced therapist to help you if you feel misunderstood by others. You may want to tryspeaking to one via BetterHelp.comfor quality care at its most convenient.

It’s easy to jump to negative conclusions when you feel no one understands you.

Maybe they don’t understand you because they think you’re weird. Or perhaps there’s something wrong with you.

Luckily, that’s usually not the case.

You are notsoweird thatno oneunderstands you out of billions of people in this world.

Nothing could besowrong with you that no one could relate to or comprehend you.

Then why do you feel this way?

Here are 8 possible reasons:

Sometimes, the challenge of feeling misunderstood starts with needing to know who you really are.

It’s like you’re looking in a mirror but seeing a blurry reflection.

You can’t quite see what you look like. It’s almost as though you’re putting on an act, pretending to be someone you’re not.

Many of us have been told who we should be or what we should like all our lives. Only as adults have we been free to try to answer those questions for ourselves.

But when you don’t know yourself, you can hardly blame others for not knowing or understanding you.

If you want tofind your place in the world,if you want others to know and ‘get’ you, you must develop self-awareness and know yourself first.

Fear might be the underlying emotion when you feel no one understands you.

Perhaps you’ve been hurt before. As a result, the memory of the pain you went through makes it difficult for you to open up to others.

You’re afraid of intimacy and vulnerability, so you unknowingly push people away.

Or you fear rejection, so you’re wary of exposing your true self to others to avoid being rebuffed or turned down.

Maybe you’re terrified of what others think about you, or you’re afraid ofnot being likedwhen you’re being yourself. You worry other people are judging you, which colors and overshadows your interactions.

Hurt feelings and broken trust can be very hard to mend. So, to protect yourself, you keep at a safe distance. You’ve built a wall around your heart to protect it from harm.

What you don’t realize is that while it keeps you safe from hurt and pain, it’s also keeping you from love and understanding.

In codependent relationships, boundaries are blurred, and individual identities are lost in the shuffle.

The lines between your and the other person’s needs are so intertwined that you feel entangled and unseen.

Your thoughts, desires, and feelings are not your own. You’re not a unique individual.

Instead, you’re a combination of personalities that do not reflect your true identity.

Add to that the constant need for approval and validation, which is a characteristic of co-dependent relationships, and it’s no wonder you feel as if no one understands you.

No one canseeyou.

Your codependent relationship has overshadowed who you truly are.

People may not understand what you’re saying or struggle to grasp your thoughts and feelings if you use a different communication style to them (and they to you).

Perhaps you have difficulty expressing your wants, desires, and thoughts verbally. The right words might elude you.

Or conversely maybe your friends and family use language in a way you don’t understand, and things get taken the wrong way.

Perhaps you assume your close friends and family should know what you mean because of your intimate relationship.

Communication is a two-way street. Expressing your thoughts, desires, and needs is crucial for fostering understanding.

So, for both parties, it’s important to be explicit and not assume people know what you mean.

If you find expressing yourself difficult, explain this to people so they can be more understanding.

That way when misunderstandings happen, people can act with compassion, rather than taking offense.

It’s possible you feel misunderstood because you expect one person to meet all your emotional, mental, and physical needs.

It’s like you’re living in a house that has multiple doors, all with different locks. But you expect a single key to open all the doors.

As complex human beings, one person can’t understand every aspect of our multifaceted personalities.

One person cannot be everything to you and for you. You need different people to contribute to your diverse needs.

For example, different people may be better at providing emotional, social, practical, or informational support.

You will rarely find someone who excels in all those areas, so expecting one person to support you in all those ways will only lead to disappointment and isolation.

Different connections serve different purposes.

Embracing this reality helps to alleviate the burden on any particular relationship, fostering a more realistic and fulfilling approach to human connections.

Do you expect your relationships to bloom overnight?

If you often feel like others don’t understand you, it might be because your relationships are moving too fast.

Relationships need time to unfold naturally.

Pushing for speed in a new relationship may create an illusion of understanding rather than foster a genuine connection. It takes time for trust and intimacy to deepen.

Wanting to become close to someone quickly makes it hard for deep understanding to grow. Also, expecting your partner to be everything to and for you makes it hard for you to see how others can help and support you.

Relationships, like stories, work best when they go at their own pace.

You may be feeling as though nobody understands you because of an underlying mental health condition like depression.

Mental health problems can cause you to feel as though you have a heavy, dark cloud over you, making everything seem harder.

You’ll struggle to articulate your emotions or you may even hide them out of shame.

This will make it especially hard for others to understand what you’re feeling or going through.

Your mental health may even influence your perception, causing you to feel as though no one understands you.

If you find yourself caught in the grips of a mental health crisis, it’s important to recognize that it’s not a personal shortcoming but a condition that many people battle.

Surrounding yourself with the wrong group of friends can make you feel misunderstood.

It’s like trying to wear your shoes on the wrong foot; the fit just isn’t right. Your feet will feel uncomfortable and restricted.

Being constantly surrounded by people who don’t resonate with your values and interests, or who don’t understand your communication style, can lead to a sense of isolation.

It could also be that the friends you have no longer fit with the person you’re becoming as you mature and grow.

It’s okay to outgrow your social group as you evolve and change. Friends who once understood you might not necessarily continue to do so as you embark on new paths and gain new perspectives.

Don’t stay with people out of familiarity. Forcing yourself to stay with the wrong group of friends might eventually impact your sense of connection.

Now that you understand why you feel misunderstood let’s figure out what you can do about it.

These 10 suggestions will not only help others better understand you, but they’ll also help you better understand yourself.

In turn, you’ll be better able to build stronger connections with other people.

You may wish to consider speaking to a therapist, either in person or via an online platform such asBetterHelp.combecause professional therapy can be highly effective in helping you to work through issues such as feeling misunderstood by everyone in your life.

Working out the best way to communicate with others is essential to ensuring people understand you.

Try a different approach if your usual way of talking doesn’t get your message across.

You could try taking a moment to think clearly about what you want to say before you say it. Or jotting down your thoughts so you have clarity on your message.

If you know you struggle with verbal communication, tell people. They will (hopefully) be more compassionate and forgiving of any conversational faux pas if they know.

Similarly, if you know you take things literally or find it hard to follow long-winded stories, politely explain this so other people can adjust their communication style.

Another point to consider is adapting your communication based on who you’re talking to.

We don’t all understand things the same way or at the same level. Use simple words you know everyone will understand to ensure your message is understood.

Effective communication is not just about expressing yourself. It’s also about listening and understanding others.

When done correctly, communication fosters connection.

You cultivate better understanding and deeper connections by actively working on expressing yourself in different ways, adjusting your approach based on your audience, and being a good listener.

So, explore different ways of maximizing your communication skills. This may also mean finding people who communicate in the same style as you to avoid misunderstandings (more on this later).

This can make a significant difference in helping you feel more understood and building meaningful connections with those around you.

Changing your mindset is a great way to help you stop feeling as though you’re being misunderstood.

Instead of viewing this experience as negative, consider it an opportunity to gain clarity and build deeper connections.

People may not always comprehend your perspective immediately. But does that mean they don’t want to understand?

Absolutely not.

Maybe they need to hear your message differently.

Use situations like this as opportunities to explain yourself differently. See them as avenues to fostering clearer communication.

Also, change your focus. Stop focusing on what people don’t understand and focus on what they do understand.

We often get caught up in believing that ‘nobody understands me’.

However, if you pay attention, you’ll likely find instances where peopledoshow understanding.

It just might not be in the way you expect or to the degree you’d like.

Acknowledge and appreciate those moments.

Lastly, let go of the victim mentality, where you feel like everything is happeningtoyou.

Recognize that you can influence and shape your experiences. You regain a sense of control by taking responsibility for your actions and reactions.

You have the power and the ability to help people understand you or to find people who do understand you.

It’s all within your control.

Your mindset alters the way you see the world. By changing it, you empower yourself to navigate relationships with a more positive and open perspective, paving the way for greater understanding.

If you want others to understand you, you must first understand yourself.

Other people can’t possibly understand you if you don’t.

That’s why self-awareness is crucial in helping you overcome the feeling of being misunderstood.

Start by reflecting on yourself—think about your thoughts, feelings, and what truly matters to you.

Ask yourself these questions to truly get to know yourself:

Take some time off from the busyness of life to delve deep into these questions. Consider it a pause for self-discovery, away from external influences.

They’ll help you figure out who you are at your core.

Once you’ve done that, fall in love with yourself by acknowledging and embracing your strengths. Celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. Recognize your unique qualities.

Self-love is a foundation for building confidence and resilience.

Lots of people find journaling can be a powerful tool in this journey. Journalling allows you to track your growth, gain insights into your emotions, and clarify your goals.

See your journal as your private space to express yourself openly and honestly. Write down your thoughts, experiences, and aspirations.

Understanding yourself on a deep level involves acknowledging your values, passions, and boundaries.

When you clearly understand who you are, you can communicate your needs more effectively, leading to a greater chance of being understood by others.

This process is not about perfection but about continuous self-discovery and acceptance.

It’s about fostering a stronger sense of self and more meaningful connections with those around you.

To receive understanding, give it to others.

Understanding other people is vital to fostering meaningful connections.

So be open-minded and patient and offer the understanding you wish to receive.

Empathy is at the heart of this process.

Put yourself in the shoes of others,even if you have never shared their experience and cannot relate to it.Believe that their experiences are real and valid.

Seek to understand their perspectives and feelings. This creates a foundation for mutual understanding. It helps build reciprocal understanding and nurtures stronger connections.

Give vulnerability a chance.

As scary as that feels, open yourself up to other people. Allow yourself and others to express genuine thoughts and emotions without judgment.

When vulnerability is embraced, it paves the way for more authentic and profound connections.

Understanding others involves recognizing the uniqueness of each person and appreciating the diversity of experiences.

Incorporating empathy, reciprocity, and vulnerability contribute to a more connected and understanding social landscape.

In doing so, you create a space for others to be understood and increase the likelihood of receiving the understanding you desire.

Self-esteem plays a crucial role in you feeling understood and confident in your interactions with others.

If it’s low, you’re more likely to feel misunderstood. On the other hand, if your self-esteem is high, you’ll be better equipped emotionally and mentally to view misunderstanding positively.

The first step toward building self-esteem is paying attention to your self-talk. Be aware of the language you use when talking to yourself.

Challenge those negative thoughts. Replace self-criticism with positive affirmations that highlight your strengths and achievements.

Address your fears, whether it’s a fear of failure, success, rejection, imposter syndrome, or whatever else.

Fear is a part of life. You’ll never be without it. So, in the words of Susan Jeffers, learn how to, “Feel the fear and do it anyway” through continuous action. Don’t let it keep you frozen in insecurity. Don’t wait for it to go away.

Take small steps to gradually overcome your fears, like initiating conversations or expressing your opinions.

Practice self-compassion by treating yourself with the kindness you’d offer a friend. Acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes, and mistakes do not diminish your value.

Set realistic goals and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. Engage in activities that bring you joy and a sense of accomplishment.

Pursue hobbies, set personal goals, and acknowledge your progress.

Enhancing your self-esteem builds a stronger foundation for understanding and expressing yourself authentically.

Building self-esteem is an ongoing process, but with consistent effort and self-compassion, you can create a positive self-image that positively impacts your connections with others.

If you want to break the cycle of feeling misunderstood, find your tribe.

Look for a community of like-minded peoplewith whom you can share your thoughts openly.

Connecting with people who share similar values and interests, or who communicate in a similar way to you, creates a supportive environment where understanding becomes more likely.

To find like-minded people, explore social groups, clubs, or communities that align with your interests and communication style.

Attend events or gatherings where you can meet individuals who share common passions.

Online platforms and forums dedicated to specific topics can also be valuable in connecting with your tribe.

When you finally find your ideal social group, talk often and openly with them. This is what it takes tomake friends as an adult. You have to take time out of your schedule to connect and for regular communication.

Try to express your thoughts, feelings, and experiences within this trusted circle. Be yourself around them. Let them see the true you.

The more you do this, the more likely you will be genuinely understood.

Being part of a tribe offers a space where your thoughts and feelings are acknowledged and accepted.

This shared understanding can lead to a more fulfilling sense of connection and reduce feelings of loneliness in your experiences.

Building and nurturing these connections with like-minded individuals creates a supportive foundation that enhances the likelihood of being truly understood.

Accept that people will misunderstand you.

It’s a part of life.

Not everyone will see things from your perspective, and that’s okay.

Embrace your uniqueness by acknowledging that your thoughts, feelings, and experiences are distinct to you. Refrain from constantly seeking validation. Stop looking forthings that help you come across as ‘normal’.

You’re not ‘normal’.  And that’s ok.

So accept it.

After all, everyone is unique. Just as you have your distinct qualities, so do others.

Engage in social situations that allow you to interact with various people. By exposing yourself to different viewpoints and backgrounds, you broaden your understanding and allow others to appreciate your uniqueness.

Embracing your uniqueness is about letting go of your need for constant approval and understanding.

Focus on celebrating your individuality and recognizing that diversity in thought and experience enriches your life and interactions with others.

By accepting that, you acknowledge that misunderstandings are inevitable, and aren’t something to fear.

Don’t wait for people to ask you what’s wrong.

Don’t assumeyou’re being excluded from things.

Everyone has something they’re battling with. As such, they’re often thinking about themselves and their problems.

If you wait for someone to check in with you, there’s a good chance they won’t notice if or when you’re struggling. They might simply forget.

So reach out.

Ask for help or support when you need it. This is a sign of strength and not weakness.

Think of the different types of support we mentioned earlier and decide which one you need right now: social, emotional, practical, or informational.

Then consider who in your life is best placed to offer this type of support and approach that person.

Most people are happy to help, especially if it’s something they know they are good at.

If it’s your first time doing this, it can feel awkward. So start small.

Be more open with those around you by sharing your thoughts and feelings. Openness creates a space for understanding to flourish.

Practice being vulnerable. Talk about your experiences and challenges.

Sharing your vulnerabilities deepens connections and opens the door for others to reciprocate, fostering a more understanding environment.

Initiate conversations that go beyond the surface. By sharing more about yourself and expressing your thoughts, you create opportunities for deeper relationships.

Reaching out is an active step toward breaking the cycle of feeling misunderstood.

Remember, it’s not a sign of weakness but a powerful act of self-care and a pathway to building stronger connections with those around you.

Get help for underlying issues that may be contributing to you feeling misunderstood, especially if you’re grappling with a mental health condition like depression.

Therapists can provide valuable insights and strategies to help you address these underlying challenges and develop healthy coping mechanisms.

They are trained to navigate complex emotions. They provide a safe space for open communication without judgment.

BetterHelp.comis a website where you can connect with a therapist via phone, video, or instant message.

Therapy can equip you with tools to manage stress, understand your communication style, and build healthier relationships.

By addressing mental health concerns, therapy becomes a pivotal resource in fostering a deeper understanding of yourself and your interactions with others.

Here’s that link againif you’d like to learn more about the serviceBetterHelp.comprovide and the process of getting started.

Exercise patience with yourself during the process of seeking understanding.

The feeling of being misunderstood is a universal experience. Everyone encounters it at some point.

Be patient with your emotions. Recognize that working through these feelings takes time.

The journey toward being understood is a process. So, give yourself the space to grow and evolve.

Extend patience to others as well. Just as you strive for understanding, recognize that those around you are also on their individual journeys.

People may not always grasp your perspective immediately. Being patient in your communication can lead to a clearer understanding over time.

Patience is not a sign of passive waiting but an active acknowledgment of the time and effort required to foster genuine connections.

By being patient with yourself and the process, you contribute to a more compassionate and understanding environment for yourself and those around you.

——

It’s vital to recognize that everyone is unique, with their own set of thoughts, feelings, and experiences.

The journey toward feeling understood involves navigating through these differences with patience and open-mindedness.

Building a supportive tribe that celebrates your uniqueness can help.

But misunderstandings are bound to happen. They are a natural part of human interaction.

Rather than viewing them as barriers, see them as opportunities for clarification and growth.

By acknowledging the uniqueness of yourself and others and accpeing that misunderstandings are a natural part of the human experience, you pave the way for more fulfilling and empathetic connections in your journey toward feeling truly understood.

5 Signs You Need Stronger Boundaries - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGswK4UPfoU

Transcript:
(00:00) imagine this you consistently say yes to requests even when they drain your energy yes yes yes you bite your tongue when someone insults you because you don't want to deal with the conflict over time you become a simmering pot of resentment that shows up in snarkiness and low self-worth these are just some of the outcomes of having weak boundaries I'm Dr Tracy Marx a psychiatrist and I make mental health education videos today I'm going to give you five signs that you need stronger boundaries number one is overc
(00:32) committing or people pleasing an example of this is consistently agreeing to take on tasks when you feel overloaded you may fear disappointing the person or fear that saying no will feel mean or withholding we all have a narrative identity this is the story about yourself that you have in your head that brings together your past present and future and gives you purpose I will talk more in detail about narrative identity and how to uncover yours in another video that will be linked to this one let's say part of your narrative
(01:05) identity is that you're not a selfish person and that selfishness is saying no to something that you're capable of doing there are no unreasonable requests and if you have the ability or skill to do something there's no legitimate reason to say no saying no is denying others you could believe this because this attitude was modeled for you by an authority figure or someone that you looked up to and this didn't have to be during childhood you could have been in an adult relationship with a person with
(01:38) a strong personality Who convinced you that saying no is selfish or you could be very sensitive to other people's feelings and have a low threshold of tolerance for seeing people disappointed whatever the source if this is your mindset you will be prone to overc committing to things and doing things that you really don't want to do but feel obligated to to do to spare someone else disappointment what can you do about this keep in mind that strengthening boundaries is an iterative process you make small changes and
(02:10) continue to revise the power behind saying no will come from identifying your needs wants and values first so that you can remind yourself of why you're saying no your need or value is the justification for saying no then start by saying no to low stakes situations these are things that have the least personal impact the small NOS will help you build the confidence to say no to the bigger things like things that only you can do and lots of people would benefit if you would just give your time to this to make saying no
(02:46) easier prepare a script or rehearse a response for common situations and remind yourself that saying no is an act of self- care and not a rejection of others number two is feeling responsible for others emotions an example of this is constantly worrying about making others upset or angry and changing your own behavior to keep people happy even at the expense of your own well-being an intervention for this is to develop self-awareness by recognizing when you're absorbing other people's emotions when there are strong
(03:21) emotions in the air practice distinguishing between what you actually feel and what the other person is expressing you'll need to remind yourself that you're not responsible for how others feel number three being unable to express your personal needs or opinions so in a relationship you don't express your desires or opinions you go along with what the other person wants neglecting your own needs and this is pretty common if you're conflict avoidant you'd rather go along with what the other person says than challenge
(03:52) them or ruin the mood with your contrary opinion here's one thing you can do start by identifying your own needs and opinions in private through journaling or self-reflection or through the narrative identity exercise that I'll talk about next week think of opinions that you've held back on expressing for fear of starting an argument or being judged practice spontaneously voicing these opinions around people who are supportive and open-minded so they won't mind you saying these things and give
(04:23) you the space to do so this practice will help you build up to expressing them in situations where you can't predict the reactions number four is feeling guilty when prioritizing yourself and this is related to being unable to say no but this is specifically around the issue of putting yourself first when you do say no or think about saying no an example is feeling a ton of guilt when you set aside time for self-care or personal interests you don't feel good about doing that because you believe it's a
(04:55) waste of productive time or selfish not to be available to others here's an example let's say you're an accountant by trade and during tax season when you're working long hours your friend asks you to give them a call later this evening so they can run some ideas by you regarding their taxes before they meet with their accountant or Worse your good friend asks if you don't mind giving their sister some advice and you're not friends with their sister now at the end of the workday you're

Healthy boundaries define what is appropriate behavior in our relationships – behavior that keeps both parties safe.

And setting healthy boundaries is crucial for self-care and positive relationships.

But let’s first understand what boundaries are.

Boundaries differ from person to person and are mediated by variations in culture, personality, and social context. Boundaries appropriate in a business meeting would seem irrelevant in a nightclub with old friends! Setting boundaries defines our expectations of ourselves and others in different kinds of relationships.

Below, we will examine definitions of relationship boundaries, how to set healthy boundaries, the different types of boundaries, and how to establish healthy boundaries in different contexts. We review the New York Times bestseller “Set Boundaries, Find Peace”.

In addition, we offer thesefree Positive Relationships PDF worksheetsto help your clients define and set healthy boundaries—essential for healthy relationships.

Let’s define boundaries. Put simply:

“A boundary is a limit or edge that defines you as separate from others”

(Katherine, 2010, p. 14).

Our skin is an obvious physical boundary, but we have other kinds ofinterpersonalboundaries too, including a limit that extends beyond our body.

Consider what happens when somebody stands too close for comfort. We often describe it as someone invading our personal space, but definitions of personal space vary according to culture, the type of relationship involved, and social context.

Comfortable boundaries with your partner at home, would not be appropriate in a different social context, such as attending a business dinner together.

Similarly, the level of physical intimacy deemed appropriate for expression in public spaces varies wildly across cultures.

When I lived in Sri Lanka, it was customary for children to greet their parents by touching their feet rather than hugging them. Meanwhile, touching, hugging, and kissing between married couples was frowned upon in public.

However, in the UK, hugging and kissing in public is acceptable, and embraces between friends, partners, and family members are deemed appropriate in shared public spaces.

Having said that, we all have friends or family members who are personally uncomfortable with hugging in any situation other than in private with their partner. Each individual is different.

So, in summary, a relationship boundary is an interpersonal limit that is mediated by variations in personality, culture, and social context.

Setting healthy boundaries requiresself-awareness. We need to be clear about our expectations of ourselves and others, and what we are and are not comfortable with in specific situations. Setting healthy boundaries requires goodcommunication skillsthat convey assertiveness and clarity.

Assertivenessinvolves expressing your feelings openly and respectfully. It does not entail making demands, but it requires people to listen to you. Setting healthy boundaries requires you to assert your needs and priorities as a form of self-care. Tawwab outlines three easy steps to setting healthy boundaries:

Step 1. Be as clear and as straightforward as possible. Do not raise your voice.Step 2. State your need or request directly in terms of what you’d like, rather than what you don’t want or like.Step 3. Accept any discomfort that arises as a result, whether it’s guilt, shame, or remorse.

The third step is common for people with poor boundaries,codependencyissues, or are people pleasers.

Sometimes, adults have been raised by childhood carers who’ve taught them that expressing their needs is bad and selfish. However, not accepting the discomfort that comes from setting healthy boundaries in adulthood means settling for unhealthy relationships that can cause resentment, manipulation, and abuse.

Examples of healthy boundaries include:

Setting healthy boundaries also requires an awareness of different boundaries involved in relationships, as illustrated in our ‘7 Types of Boundaries’ diagram below.

In this section, we will look at personal and emotional boundaries. In the diagram above, personal boundaries refer to all seven types of boundaries that affect our personal wellbeing.

When we maintain healthy boundaries in all seven domains we will thrive, but when others cross or violate our boundaries, there will be a personal cost if we do not address it.

One domain refers to emotional boundaries which determine how emotionally available you are to other people. We all need support at different times when life hits us with unexpected events, or just help to process the onslaught of micro stressors during the day, sometimes referred to as ‘daily hassles’ in the psychology literature (Falconier et al., 2015).

However, we can’t always be there for people as we often have other priorities to attend to, such as work, domestic, and family responsibilities. As adults, we must take care of ourselves first. Self-care is the foundation of health, while putting others’ needs before our own is a characteristic of codependency that can lead toburnout.

When we don’t maintain healthy emotional boundaries with others, we may feel resentful, guilty, and drained.

As in the 7 Types of Boundaries diagram above, it is perfectly OK to state your limitations to people who make demands of your emotional resources. If they push back against your boundaries or continue to violate them, then this shows your relationship may be off balance, problematic, or even toxic.

If so, then restate your boundary and withdraw calmly. There is no need to over-explain yourself or apologize for setting boundaries, as everyone may say what they do and do not want to do.

When we are dealing with people who repeatedly cross or violate our personal boundaries, then the whole nature of the relationship may need to change. This can be tricky when the relationship is with somebody we cannot escape, such as co-workers and family members.

The rest of the article focuses on how to set healthy boundaries in specific relationship contexts.

Boundaries are essential for maintaining psychological wellbeing, especially when providing psychological services to clients as mental health professionals.

There is extensive literature on the harms caused by poor boundaries and boundary violations in clinical relationships with patients and clients (Aiyegbusi & Kelly, 2012; Aravind, Krishnaram & Thasneem, 2012; Davies, 2007).

TheAPA’s psychologists’ code of ethicsdoes not make any explicit statements about professional boundaries, although it covers related areas including:

Similarly, theBPShas no explicit statement on boundaries in their code of ethics for British psychologists and associated clinical professions, but outlines key principles including confidentiality and the related code of conduct (British Psychological Society, 2021).

Meanwhile, the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) has a detailed position statement on boundaries which begins as follows:

“It is a therapist’s duty to keep their clients psychologically safe. Boundaries are agreed limits or rules which help provide this safety and protect both the client and the therapist. They set a formal structure, purpose and standards for the therapy and the therapeutic relationship” (British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, 2020, para. 3).

Health professionals of all kinds occupy a position of trust in their patients’ and clients’ lives. In legal terms, clinical and caring professionals have a fiduciary duty toward their clients as beneficiaries of their services that entails maintaining professional boundaries that protect the client’s interests above their own, at all times (Aravind, Krishnaram & Thasneem, 2012).

Maintaining healthy boundaries at work has become increasingly difficult with flexible working, remote and hybrid working, and technological progress.

Setting boundaries at work begins during the interview process, where you can establish what kinds of work practices you will accept, especially accessibility during working hours, out-of-hours working, and remote working arrangements.

Career Contessaoffers eight tips for establishing healthy boundaries in the workplace.

Watch their video below for more detail.

If you find yourself in a workplace where your boundaries are repeatedly crossed or violated despite setting boundaries, then you may be being bullied or harassed. Look at this article onworkplace bullyingon how to manage and address the situation.

The tips for keeping healthy boundaries in friendships include some points mentioned above, especially understanding your personal limits in terms of time and emotional investment.

These can also change as life events occur that entail a shift in priorities. For example, the time and energy you invest in friendships may change after starting a family. Your children become a priority and friendships may become less important until your children become more independent.

In the TED Talk below, Shasta Nelson describes the three requirements for healthy friendships that she calls ‘frientimacy’ as:

Setting boundaries and maintaining them with friends requires mutual trust and respect. Refer to our seven types of boundaries diagram above to consider your boundaries in friendships.

Boundary setting with friends who have crossed or violated them can be difficult, and you may experience pushback. If so, reassert the boundary again and be prepared to take a break from them by ignoring messages and calls for a while if the pushback continues.

Dr. Nicole LePera is a clinical psychologist trained at Cornell University in the US who has her own YouTube channel called the Holistic Psychologist. In the video below, she outlines the three key boundaries she has identified as essential for healthy friendships:

This section will take a brief look at boundaries in intimate relationships between partners. Many of the tips offered above also apply to intimate partnerships, including marriage. Let’s just take a moment to consider this quote:

“Boundaries are the gateway to healthy relationships.”

(Tawwab, 2021, p. 3)

Romantic relationships often run into trouble when implicit assumptions are made about shared values and relationship goals.

The key to having healthy intimate partnerships is clear communication between partners about mutual needs and expectations. Our worksheets below will provide further guidance.

This video by FlexTalk discusses how to set and maintain healthy boundaries in marriage, which also applies to any committed intimate partnership.

‘Setting limits won’t disrupt a healthy relationship’ says the author of this book, Nedra Glover Tawwab, a psychotherapist. (Tawwab, 2021, p. 130).

If you struggle with setting boundaries, then this book is for you. It prioritizes the self-care we need to look after ourselves and others.

The author uses real-life case histories from her therapeutic practice to illustrate a range of problems caused by poor boundaries.

In each chapter, she offers exercises to help readers identify communication skills deficits that lead to poor boundaries and provides helpful tips on how to set and maintain boundaries.

By setting boundaries in relationships, we also discover which relationships are healthy and which are not. As Tawwab explains, if friends, family members, or work colleagues push back against our boundaries by ignoring them, challenging them, or cutting us off, then the relationship was already in deep trouble and needed to end.

However, boundaries are not walls. Tawwab says that behavior that erects walls, such as cutting people off without giving them a right to reply, (sometimes called ghosting) or prolonged silent treatment, is not about setting healthy boundaries, it is emotionally abusive.

Part two is a guide on how to set boundaries in all kinds of relationships, including family, romantic relationships, friendships, at work, and with social media and technology use. This is all followed up by a self-assessment quiz to help you check your progress.

Appropriate boundaries can look very different depending on the setting, but it’s important to set them in all areas of life where we interact with others.

Finally, while setting boundaries is crucial, it is just as important to respect others’ boundaries, including parents, children, romantic partners, managers, coworkers, and anyone else we interact with.

Are these worksheets free to use in other settings?

Thank you, Jo, for this insightful, article written simply and with such clarity (not an easy thing to do). I’ll be drawing on it in a piece of work I’m doing with a group of women who have great demands on them and who themselves are dealing with a lot of trauma in their lives. Boundaries and maintaining them keep cropping up.  So over the next few weeks we are giving space to working through this and learning to establish and maintain healthy boundaries. Your Positive Relationship Resources will be invaluable.  You’re very generous in providing these freely here. I will acknowledge your work over the weeks. With gratitude. Marie

I find this article very interesting and educational because I think everyone of us has set boundaries because people can take advantage of one another by not accepting “no” for an answer.

Many people have the wrong idea about boundaries. They believe that they already have good boundaries when in reality they have brick walls, or they believe that boundaries are "unkind."

Healthy boundaries are the ultimate guide tosuccessful relationships. Without healthy boundaries, relationships do not thrive—they result in feelings of resentment, disappointment, or violation. These feelings, unchecked, can lead to being cut off from others or enmeshment, where there's no clear division between you and others' needs and feelings. Neither of these situations is ideal.

Because so few of us understand what boundaries actually are, we rarely see evidence of them working. But when they do, you feel it—it does wonders for your mental and relational health.

Boundaries are what happen when you can sense yourself and what you need and wantandaccess your voice to speak to those things. We all have "limits," and we all experience violations of our limits.

Most of the time, people are not trying to violate your limits—they just aren't aware of what they are. Sometimes, this is because we arenot clear with ourselvesor other people about what we want or need.

Below are six boundaries you deserve to have and what they might look like in practice.

RELATED:6 Steps For Setting Good Boundaries & Maintaining Them

Physical boundaries include your needs for personal space, your comfort with touch, and your physical needs like needing to rest, eat food, and drink water.

It is OK to let people know that you don't want to be touched or that you need more space. It is also OK to say that you are hungry or that you need to rest.

Healthy physical boundaries might sound like:

Physical boundary violations feel like receiving inappropriate or unwanted touch, being denied your physical needs (told to keep walking when you are tired or that you need to wait to eat or drink), or having someone come into your personal space in a way that is uncomfortable (entering your room without permission, for example). This can vary on a spectrum from mild to severe. The most severe violations result in serious physical abuse or neglect.

Emotional boundaries are all about respecting and honoring feelings and energy. Setting emotional boundaries means recognizinghow much emotional energyyou are capable of taking in, knowing when to share and when not to share, and limiting emotional sharing with people who respond poorly. Respecting emotional boundaries means validating the feelings of others and making sure you respect their ability to take in emotional information.

It might sound like:

Emotional boundary violations include:

Your time is valuable, and it is important to protect how it is utilized. Setting time boundaries is incredibly important at work, home, and socially. Setting time boundaries means understanding your priorities and setting aside enough time for the many areas of your lifewithout overcommitting. When you understand your priorities, it is much easier to limit the amount of time you are giving to other people.

Healthy time boundaries might sound like:

Violated time boundaries looks like asking professionals for their time without paying them, demanding time from people, keeping people in conversations or on tasks for longer than we told them we would, showing up late or canceling on people because we overcommitted, and contacting people when they said they would be unavailable.

Healthy sexual boundaries include consent, agreement, respect, understanding of preferences and desires, and privacy.

Healthy sexual boundaries include:

This might sound like:

Sexual boundary violations include:

Intellectual boundaries refer to your thoughts, ideas, and curiosity. Healthy intellectual boundaries include respect for the ideas of other people, and they can be violated when your thoughts and curiosity are shut down, dismissed, or belittled. Respectfulness and willingness to dialogue and understand are important here.

Healthy intellectual boundaries also mean considering whether or not it is a good time to talk about something.

They might sound like:

Does this mean that you need to be accepting of all thoughts and opinions? Absolutely not. It is also important to learn to recognize the difference between healthy and unhealthy discourse. If someone is sharing an opinion that is inherently harmful—i.e., racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, etc.—then you have every right to put a hard line in the sand. You can set the boundary in your own way. It might sound like letting the person know you do not tolerate that kind of talk, distancing yourself from them, or cutting off. You do not have to have "intellectual" discourse with someone who is violating you or other people.

Material boundaries refer to items and possessions like your home, car, clothing, jewelry, furniture, money, etc. It is healthy to understand what you can and cannot share and how you expect your items and materials to be treated by the people you share them with.

Having limits on how your material items are treated is healthy and prevents resentment over time.

This might sound like:

Material boundaries are violated when your things are destroyed or stolen or when they are "borrowed" too frequently. Another material violation is the use of materials (money and possessions) to manipulate and control relationships.

The more we set boundaries, the more we recognize them. In setting boundaries, we help people show up for us, and we also become better at showing up for them.

In the words of Brené Brown, "Clear is kind."

Follow these suggestions for recovering from burnout, stress and anxiety, which include speaking with a therapist and paying attention to your needs.

Your brain and body can only handle feeling overworked and overwhelmed for so long.

If you consistently experiencehigh levels of stresswithout taking steps to manage or reduce it, exhaustion eventually takes over — leaving you emotionally and physicallyburned out.

You may begin to feel less motivated since it seems like nothing you do matters.

Since burnout happens gradually, you might not notice symptoms immediately. But once it takes hold, it can affect your ability to function across all aspects of life.

Below, we cover the signs of burnout and outline some strategies to cope.

Keysignsof burnout include:

Estimates suggest anywhere between4 and 7 percentof the working public may experience burnout, though workers in certain fields, such as healthcare, tend to experience burnout atmuch higher rates.

Burnout can have a far-reaching impact, often:

Taking action to address burnout is essential, since it generally only gets worse. The next 10 steps can help you get started on the road to recovery.

It’s tough to make changes when you don’t know exactly what needs to change, but exploring contributing factors or sources of stress in your life can help.

Burnoutoften relates to job and professional triggers, like the stress of an increasingly demanding job. But you could also experience burnout when:

Trying to do too much on your own also creates an ideal environment for burnout to fester.

“Eventually you bend so much you break, and that’s when burnout happens,” explainsBarrie Sueskind, LMFT, a therapist in Los Angeles.

Say you’re a single parent with a full-time job, trying to take online classes, and keep up with friends and loved ones at the same time.

The stress that accompanies each single factor might be manageable on its own, but the combination can easily overwhelm you if you don’t take steps to get support.

You might recognize a few ways to lighten your load right away.

Three different time-consuming projects keeping you working long hours, week after week?

“Those with a lot of ambition to succeed in their careers are tempted to do it all,” Sueskind says. But this can backfire when you end up with no energy for anything.

Instead, try accepting that doing it all isn’t realistic, and ask your supervisor to reassign one project or add someone else to your team.

Overwhelmed with work and personal commitments but still can’t bring yourself to turn down requests from loved ones?

“Those withpeople-pleasingtendencies often take on too much to avoid letting anyone down,” Sueskind says.

If you’re already running out of hours in the day for the things you absolutely need to do, adding more tasks will only add more frustration and stress.

Evaluate your existing commitments and consider canceling or rescheduling a few. The immediate relief this brings may surprise you.

If you feel unsure of how to begin sorting through the causes of burnout and looking for ways to ease your stress, that’s normal.

Burnout can become so overwhelming that determining how to address it still seems exhausting. It’s also hard to identify potential solutions when you feel completelyspent.

Involving a trusted loved one can help you feel supported and less alone. Friends, family members, and partners can help you brainstorm possible solutions.

They’re close enough to your life to have some understanding of what works for you but still have enough distance to consider the situation with some clarity.

Opening up to people about the distress you’re experiencing can take some courage, especially when you worry they’ll see you as incapable or lazy.

But struggling through burnout alone can make overcoming it more difficult.

And you never know, your loved ones may have experienced burnout themselves and could have some valuable insight to share.

Confronting burnout isn’t easy, especially when it’s already taken a toll on your personal relationships and quality of life.

A therapist can offer professional guidance by helping you identify causes, explore possible coping methods, and navigate any life challenges contributing to burnout.

Burnout can provoke feelings of helplessness and can also play a part in feelings ofdepression, so it’s particularly important to talk with a therapist if you:

Resetting yourself after burnout can be a lengthy process — but by choosing to address it, you’ve already taken the first step.

Unfortunately, addressing burnout isn’t always straightforward. But this doesn’t have to mean it will hold you down forever.

You may not see an easy road to recovery, but a little exploration may unearth some kind of path.

Maybe your boss keeps piling work on, despite your requests for help from co-workers or time to finish current projects first.

It might be time to start searching for a new job that respects your capabilities.

If you feel burned out because of relationship difficulties, a counselor can offer support as you take a closer look at your relationship and whether it’s serving your best interests.

In short, when you give everything you have and it still isn’t enough, there’s not much more you can do besides move on — for your own sake.

Sometimes, just knowing other routes exist can renew hope and help you remember you have power to make changes, even if those changes don’t happen right away.

Burnout can make you feel powerless. You might feel as if your life is rushing past and you can’t keep up.

If outside factors contributed to burnout, you might blame these circumstances and have a hard time seeing what you can do to change the situation.

You may not have had control over what happened to bring you to this point, but youdohave the power to take back control and begin to recharge.

To start, try these tips:

Setting limitson the time you give to others can help you manage stress while recovering from burnout.

“Accepting too many commitments can cause overwhelm,” Sueskind explains.

Before you agree to help someone or accept an invitation, she recommends the following:

Part of boundary setting also involves learning to say no.

“You’re not lazy, selfish, or mean for declining a request for your precious time,” Sueskind emphasizes. “Being selective about accepting commitments is key to taking care of your mental health, honoring the truly important commitments, and proactively preventing burnout.”

Reaching a point of burnout can bring up feelings of failure and a loss of purpose or life direction. You might feel as if you can’t do anything properly or you’ll never achieve your goals.

When you reach a point of burnout, you’ve probably pushed yourself past the point of what most people would realistically consider themselves capable of for some time.

What would you say to a friend in your situation? Chances are, you’d offer empathy and kindness instead of telling them how utterly they failed.

Grant yourself the samelove and support. Remind yourself you don’t have to be perfect, and that it’s OK to need a break.

So maybe you can’t complete three proposals at once. Who can, really? And so what if you didn’t ace that last exam? You still got a decent score.

In the end, all you can do is your best with the strengths you have. But you’ll find it easier to use those strengths when you aren’t running on empty.

Taking charge of your physical and mental health is key to burnout recovery.

In an ideal world, reaching the point of burnout would mean you immediately take time off, clear your schedule, and dedicate your days to rest and relaxation.

But most people simply can’t do that.

If you have bills to pay and children to take care of, quitting may seem impossible until you have other prospects.

If you’re caring for a sick family member who has no other relatives, you may not have anyone else to turn to for support.

Practicing goodself-carecan make recharging easier while you try other strategies to reset.

Try these tips:

Severe burnout can drain you and make it hard to remember what you used to enjoy.

You may have lost your passion for a career you once loved and feel angry and resentful when you get to work each day.

Perhaps you no longer care about your favorite hobbies, or you’ve stopped responding to texts from friends because you lack the energy for conversation.

You might even feel perpetually irritated and snap at your partner or family without meaning to.

To counter these feelings, create a list of the things that bring you joy. It might include things like:

Make time for these activities every week, and keep this habit up even after you feel more like yourself.

We’ve all had days—or more than a year (a la 2020 and 2021)—when we feel like a salmon swimming upstream: we exert our best effort, only to be swept back by forces beyond our control. To make matters worse, we all know what happens to the salmon when they reach the end of their journey.

But what if your entire job starts to feel like an ill-fated upriver struggle? What started as your dream job somehow morphed into a nightmare. Now what? The three big determinants of burnout are emotional exhaustion, reduced accomplishment, and something called depersonalization, which is basically growing bitter and cynical about the people you’re supposed to care enough about to serve. How to handle this trifecta of misery? Read on for seven tips to help you handle burnout.

This is cliché, but take care of yourself. When was the last time you ate lunch without staring at your computer or spent a night without Netflix? How much wine are you drinking after work? When was the last time you exercised? Make a decision to tradescreen timefor shuteye, skip fast food, and work regular exercise back into your routine.

According to the foremost expert in the field of burnout, Dr. Christina Maslach of the University of California, Berkeley, work problems can be boiled down to six things:

Once you’ve pinpointed what’s snuffing your fire, try...

The opposite of job burnout is something calledjob engagement. So imagine what it would take for you to be engaged. Where would you like to be? What comes to mind when you think about a great place to work? How can you feel like you can have some autonomy about your work, rather than having decisions made for you?

Once you’ve pinpointed the problem(s), see if you can create a better match. Some problems are intractable, like working against your values or an unethicalcompany culture. For that, see Tip #5. But sometimes change is possible. Can you diversify your job description? Transfer to another team or location within the company? Justify hiring an assistant? Make the case for flex time or working from home one day a week? If the problem is social, can you suggest some changes that will help all employees?

Make some executive decisions. If making a better match doesn’t work, it might be a sign to look for another role someplace else or consider if now’s a good time to go back to school.

Hear me out on this one: By “delegate” I don’t mean reassign the part of your job you dread to the intern. Instead, fight the feeling that you’re the only one who can handle things.

Interestingly, those with a sense ofover-responsibility—you think if you want something done right you have to do it yourself—are more vulnerable to burnout. And sometimes your thought might be true—your dissertation, your patients—sometimes you are the one in charge. But sometimes things can be delegated. If you suspect you’re a little on the over-responsible side, test out delegation and see what happens.

By the time we burn out, we’ve often become one-dimensional. Life whittles down to work and a workout when we’re done, which we chalk up to “taking care of ourselves” but is really just another duty. Do things youwantto do, not just more things youshoulddo. Ask yourself what you used to like to do, and then dust off your hiking boots, your madeleine pan, or your table saw. And to that end, take your time off too; whether you take a few days after you finish that big work project or after you wrap up your current job and before you start the next one. During your vacation, see friends, if you can swing it, travel, or at least rest: read some novels, work on your house, or play with your kids.

So if you reflexively enter your work password when logging into your personal computer, test out some of these seven tips. You'll go fromburned outto fanning the flames.

It’s increasingly common for someone to be diagnosed with a condition such as ADHD or autism as an adult. A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers.


Feeling burned out at work? There’s a coping method for that.

If you’re dreading going to work, hatching your escape plan, or are simply too overwhelmed to even think about the future, you could be experiencing job burnout.

And you wouldn’t be alone. According to theAmerican Psychological Association’s (APA’s)2021 Work and Well-being Survey, 79% of employees reported experiencing work-related stress in that month.

While burnout can start at work, it can also seep into other parts of your life and affect your energy, motivation, and overall quality of life. Burnout is also common with caregiving for children or elderly parents.

There are steps you can take to cope with job burnout.

Mental health experts shared 11 actionable ideas that might help you overcomeburnout. Consider trying some of these strategies to see which ones work for you.

It’s easy to put work at the center of identity and self-worth. That’s why returning to your personal core values is critical.

“Our values drive behavior and impact our thought processes and decision-making,” explainsJason Phillips, a licensed therapist.

By figuring out your values, you cancreate better boundariesand build your version of work-life balance by zeroing in on what’s most important to you.

If you’re unsure where to start, here’s alist of valuesyou can explore.

Want to get away? Consider a retreat, suggests Phillips. “A solo retreat can be helpful to reconnect with yourself without distractions from others,” says Phillips. “This also allows you to live on your own terms and be transparent about what you need.”

A wellness retreat could be a transformative experience. But even a night away in a local city, a day trip to a local botanical garden, or a personal picnic in a nearby park can give you some space to think about your needs.

If you’re burned out, it may be time to shift your priorities. “Work is important and vital — but so are you,” saysJonathan Alpert, a psychotherapist in New York. “Think about who you are outside of an employee. Know your mental and physical needs and then prioritize them.”

If you thrive personally when you have time for morning coffee with your partner or a weekday sports league, schedule those into your calendar and take the appointment with yourself as seriously as a work meeting.

If you’re feeling burned out at work, you could start at the source. “Rather than fearing or avoiding your supervisor, see them as an important person in helping to bring about positive change,” offers Alpert. “Most supervisors I know realize that a happy and content employee is a productive one.”

“Approach your supervisor with that mindset, and enlist their help in making your work more desirable,” he suggests.

“Sometimes we don’t realize we’re burned out until we’re deep into it, and having another person checking in on us helps us maintain a plan for care,” saysAnjali Gowda Ferguson, a clinical psychologist based in Richmond, Virginia. “Make a plan with a friend or colleague to check in on each other’s rest and self-care.”

If you have a shared self-care activity such as hiking or yoga, set up a weekly friend date.

“When burnout is high, it can become difficult to recognize that other parts of yourself and your life exist,” explainsKailey Hockridge, a licensed professional clinical counselor based in Los Angeles.

“By finding even 10 minutes per day to engage in conversations you enjoy, meaningful movement that brings you peace, or activities you find interesting, you can start to bring the focus back to all the other parts of who you are and decrease the weight of burnout,” Hockridge says.

“My favorite strategy for pulling yourself out of burnout is joining online groups,” saysJody Dianna, a licensed clinical social worker serving in the Tennessee area. “Online groups can be ideal for meeting needs in your life that have gone unmet for far too long.”

Dianna suggests finding a private group of like-minded people. There are several options foronline support groups, depending on the type of format and interaction you prefer.

While it could seem like learning something new is just another thing to add to your list, it could help alleviate your burnout.

“Learning a new skill can combat the feeling that nothing will change, which could be the boost you need to recover and find your happiness again,” says Dianna.

Better yet, reclaim a past hobby that you’ve long felt you don’t have time for such aspaintingor singing — and try to make it a priority. Local community college classes can also be an affordable way to spark your intellectual creativity.

“Most people have adrenal fatigue or failure from burnout,” explainsAmy Babish, a coach, psychotherapist, and somatic expert in Washington. “Acupuncture is effective for balancing out your system.”

Acupuncture has also been shown to help ease symptoms ofanxietyanddepression.

“Make a list of all your warning signs of burnout, from the earliest indicators to the surefire signs,” suggestsMegan Kelly, a licensed mental health counselor in Indiana. “For each sign, come up with a solid, measurable action you can take to counteract the burnout.”

Consider making a list of things that bring you peace, and have that list handy when burnout signs pop up.

If you continue to experiencejob burnout, or if you find yourself in atoxic workenvironment, it may be time to consider looking for a new job.

You can start slowly by working on your resume, casually looking for jobs, and then gradually begin hyping yourself up to prepare for change.

“If leaving [your job] isn’t an option, you may wish to consider ways to structurally change your schedule or seek out a position within your company with lower demands,” suggests Kelly.

The three stages of burnout are:

“Burnout typically starts slowly with a slight increase in stress, more worry than usual, and small physical changes in sleep and appetite,” statesSamantha Newton, a licensed clinical social worker based in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Newton calls this the “burnout watch” stage — much like a hurricane — where the threat is close but not there yet.

Burnout warning is the next stage.

“The anxiety over going to work or dealing with the stressor is higher and happening more frequently,” Newton says. “You often feel more dread when thinking about work and have trouble finding the energy to do things you used to enjoy.”

This may also be when your health begins to decline and people start to notice.

The final stage, or full burnout, is all-consuming. “You feel like you’ve lost yourself and the issue causing your burnout has taken over your thoughts and feelings,” Newton says. “At this stage, you’re more withdrawn and recognize that you’re in an emotional and physical crisis.”

Burnout looks different for everyone, and both the stages and severity can vary. But there are several common signs you can look out for, including:

If you’re burned out, know that this feeling doesn’t have to last forever. You can begin by noticing the signs, spotting triggers, and trying various coping methods to see which ones work well for you.

Above all else, show yourself someself-compassion.

If you find yourself having difficulty managing burnout on your own, consider reaching out to a healthcare or mental health professional who can help you.

“Burnout is common, but that doesn’t mean it needs to be sidelined in our mental health,” says Hockridge. If therapy feels right to you, you can use check outPsych Central’s hub on finding mental health support.

Burnoutoccurs when a person experiences prolonged stress either from work or other obligations. Researchers describe it as consisting of three main characteristics; feeling exhausted/overwhelmed, feeling emotionally withdrawn/disengaged, and feeling a general sense ofcynicism. This third component is critical: A person who is burnt out at work isn’t just tired. They’re so overwhelmed that they’re beginning to question what it’s all for and if it’s even worth it. They’ve lostmotivation.

Historically, burnout has been viewed as problematic because of the toll it takes on an individual’s mental health and because it makes people work less hard at their jobs. More recent research, however, has found that theanxiety,depression, and sense of detachment that come from burnout also spill over into people’s intimate relationships. This makes sense when you consider that our feelings, regardless of their source, travel with us into all aspects of our lives. Although we may aim tocompartmentalizework and family, we ultimately are just one person.

The impact that burnout has on our lives is amplified by the limited nature of our time and energy. Obviously, when we invest time and energy in one domain (i.e., work) we have less of it available for other areas, like relationships. This is true even if we love our jobs and derive pleasure from performing them. Work demands energy and energy is finite.

The ebb and flow of emotions between our work and relationships travel bidirectionally. When your partner is stressed at work, they become less pleasant to be around at home. Likewise, when a person is struggling in their relationship, they have less energy and focus to dedicate to work. All of this highlights how we are not robots. We don’t come equipped with unique programming for each area in our lives. Our energy, moods, and motivation all draw from the same reservoir.

The irony, of course, is that when burnout from work spills over into our relationships, it limits the effectiveness of the very thing we need most. The support that comes from a healthy relationship fuels our energy andresilience. It helps us cope with other life stressors. Yet even the best relationships suffer when one or both partners feel burnt out. Therefore, recognizing its signs is critically important.

Here are four major signs that burnout is impacting your relationship.

1. You get irritated by your partner easily.Behaviors that ordinarily seem small (i.e. leaving the cap off of the toothpaste, leaving towels on the floor, chewing loudly) suddenly feel monumentally annoying. Your ability to shrug off or ignore your partner’s minor shortcomings feels impossible.

2. You feel less excited doing things with your partner that you both usually enjoy.Rituals that you typically enjoy together like watching a show, going out to eat, or exercising together, suddenly seem less appealing. You either feel too exhausted to do them or they feel pointless and/or not as fun.

3. You feel emotionally withdrawn and unable to connect.The idea of sharing your thoughts and emotions with your partner feels pointless. You no longer feel that running ideas by them is useful or helpful. You have a sense that they either won’t understand, won’t care enough, or that it just isn’t worth it.

4. You feel less interested in having sex.Burnout increases stresshormones, namely cortisol, which can shut down mostsexualfeelings. Depression also dampens libido, making it hard to enjoy sex.

If you feel like you or your partner are exhibiting these signs, it’s worth taking a step back to assess. Don’t automatically assume your relationship is suffering because of other underlying challenges and dynamics. Ask if at least part of the cause may be burnout. Although burnout traditionally comes from work,parentingor caring for relatives home because of the pandemic can also lead to burnout. Ironically, feeling under-challenged, either at work or in life, can also lead to burnout:Boredomcan be a major source of stress.

If you think that burnout is spilling into your relationship, aim to introduce positive emotions into it. Carve out time just for you and your partner to focus on each other with no distractions. Spend time with friends or enjoy other hobbies. Engage in self-care, whether that means taking a nap, getting a massage, or taking a vacation. Prioritize what matters to you and invite other support systems into your life to help take the load off.

A lot of people are suffering from burnout right now. According toa recent articlein the Lancet, worldwide rates of anxiety and depression are up 400% since the beginning of the pandemic. The world is currently astressful, unpredictable place. But burnout doesn’t need to define your relationship. Recognizing its causes and actively taking steps to repair and replenish can go a long way.

Transcript:
(00:07) brainy dose presents 10 reasons you can't focus and how to fix it do you have a hard time focusing when trying to complete a project while others around you can spend long periods focused solely on one thing if your answer is yes you're certainly not the only one so why is that how come some people can focus on a task and others just can't seem to be able to control their wandering minds well some personality types have more trouble staying focused but there are a variety of other reasons why you may find it difficult to
(00:41) concentrate here are some of the most common causes number one not getting enough sleep there's a reason why so many professionals constantly talk about how important sleep is not only does it help your body rest and recharge but your mind as well this means that not getting enough of it can be seriously detrimental to both although your mind takes the brunt of it your focus becomes limited because your brain is tired and confused it hasn't had enough time to prepare for the day and all of the challenges it
(01:14) brings all it wants to do is shut down and recover even in the middle of important tasks now you might think that you get enough sleep yet you can still find yourself having trouble concentrating in that case you may want to check with your doctor whether or not you have a sleep disorder you see even if you get the recommended amount of sleep it might be restless or interrupted deep restful rem sleep is what you really need and if you don't get adequate amounts you will suffer the consequences furthermore not getting enough sleep can even lead
(01:48) to depression making it even harder to stay focused number two too many distractions most people in today's age tend to interact with multiple devices at the same time like using their phone and computer while having the tv play in the background and you can say that's just the way of life but all it does is split your focus and this plays into your conversations as well when interacting with others whether virtually or in real life you think you're giving your undivided attention but with the tv creating constant
(02:22) background noise or your phone buzzing every few seconds there are too many sources of stimulation to focus on at once stop and consider how all of your devices might be hindering your ability to focus it might be helpful to distance yourself from those devices when you have something urgent that needs your full attention removing or at least limiting these distractions can be a big help number three not dealing with problems it's often said that the person who complains the loudest or the most will get the most attention when it
(02:54) comes to focus the complaint is a problem that's not being dealt with if the problem is being ignored or goes unchecked you can find yourself constantly thinking about it and how you need to address it but you never do anything about it the key to stopping these problems from continuously popping up in your head is to actually take steps to solve them merely adding something that needs to be dealt with to your to-do list or making that appointment you've been putting off can help soothe the voice in the back of your head
(03:24) even if the problem can't be solved right away just starting to work on it can clear your mind a bit and recenter your focus number four not having a good plan this one goes hand in hand with the previous point when you're dealing with something don't just go at it blindly have a plan on how you're going to approach it it's far easier and more efficient that way mechanics do the same when checking a car and so do doctors when you visit them with the health issue it can be something simple like making a
(03:55) small checklist for going to the store or something more comprehensive like drawing up the blueprints for your next big home improvement project either way preparation is key regardless of how you choose to prepare going through individual steps and instructions is much easier than trying to take on the entire project all at once number five not getting enough exercise not getting enough rest is a big problem but so is not getting enough movement regular exercise not only keeps you healthy but it's a great way to
(04:29) stimulate your body yes it's much easier to put exercise off due to a full schedule too many work hours and not enough free time but a lack of exercise takes its toll on the body and the mind regular exercise promotes brain plasticity boosts hormones and reduces stress it increases sensitivity to insulin and fights off anxiety and depression all of these factors can affect your focus and concentration so even if it's just taking the stairs instead of the elevator get some exercise to help your mind and
(05:03) body work more efficiently number six working in a messy environment if you can work quickly and efficiently in a cluttered workspace you're definitely in the minority creative types can be productive in chaotic environments but if that's not you you need to create some order in your workspace a messy space may not bother you consciously but it can still affect your subconscious mind papers folders random knickknacks and trash all over your desk are all just distractions for your brain which means you need to get rid of them
(05:37) nobody's workspace can be absolutely spotless and you're free to personalize yours but give yourself enough clear space to be able to easily focus on a given task number seven undiagnosed adhd do you have trouble listening to people following instructions and prioritizing tasks are you often irritable restless and have a lot of trouble relaxing are you late more often than not these are possible symptoms of adult adhd which means if they apply to you you're going to have a lot more trouble focusing than most people
(06:13) if you think you might have adult adhd it's best to talk to your doctor about it they will point you in the right direction whether it be prescribing medication or referring you to a therapist who can provide you with alternative ways to alleviate your symptoms number eight working too hard a lot of people work much more than they should and their ability to focus is suffering stepping away from work every now and then is beneficial for both your mental and physical health working every possible hour you can
(06:45) is only going to push your focus to deteriorate and it will lead you to be less efficient at your job and any other projects you are working on if you want to improve your focus you need to take breaks you need to give yourself and your brain some rest number nine having an unhealthy diet another essential element to a properly functioning body is fuel to keep it going and like any machine giving your body the wrong type of fuel will lead to problems having an occasional treat is fine but in order for you to function at maximum
(07:19) efficiency you must give your body the nutrients it needs forming healthier habits like bringing a water bottle to work eating more fresh fruits and vegetables and taking vitamins will be beneficial in the long run you don't need to go on any extreme diets and become a health freak but making some lifestyle changes to be healthier will help your body function better and your mind stay focused number 10 too much stress this applies to pretty much everyone especially in the fast-paced demanding world we live in
(07:51) stress becomes overwhelming and we all have some sort of anxiety angst or worry but stress is terrible for your mind and body maybe you can't eliminate the cause of the stress but finding better ways to cope with it will help you immensely whether it's practicing yoga or deep breathing exercises going for a walk or taking a nap there are many simple ways to help reduce the stresses in your life you'll be able to breathe easier once you have less stress and anxiety you'll be able to focus better and get
(08:21) more done this will further reduce stress creating a cycle of healthy behaviors not being able to focus can be extremely frustrating maybe you can't find the motivation or can't prioritize either way usually there's an underlying cause it's a multi-layered problem that at times affects everyone fortunately with a better understanding of your biology behaviors and a few practical changes you can tackle the issues affecting your concentration so you can focus on the things that matter the most what do you think what's preventing you

Your ability to focus is a skill that you can develop. Choose from a variety of effective focus-boosting techniques and tips that are proven to help.

When you can’t focus, life becomes a struggle.

Everything you do is harder and takes more time than it should.

Work, school, relationships, and confidence suffer when your attention wanders.

Spendingmoretime accomplishinglessis frustrating!

But, fortunately, focus is NOT an innate trait or talent.

It’s a skill that can be developed.

That little computer in your pocket was intentionally designed to be an addictive distraction.

Social media, YouTube, and your favorite Netflix series beckon.

It’s no wonder you can’t focus!

While the overuse of technology rightly gets a lot of the blame, it’s definitely not the only factor depleting your potential to focus.

Our modern lifestyle, in all kinds of ways, is not conducive to keeping our minds on just one thing.

Let’s look at the top 12 reasons for diminished focus and even more ways to improve your attention skills.

The definition of focus is “to pay particular attention to.”

And theonlyway to truly pay attention is to do one thing at a time.

This meansno multitasking.

The reason for multitasking — to allegedly accomplish more in less time — is counterproductive anyway.

"Steve Jobs, renowned for his ability to focus, memorably explained that “Focusing is about saying no.”

It’s a well-known fact that we can think about only one thing at a time.

When we multitask, our brains must quickly toggle back and forth between tasks.

This canwaste up to 40% of our productive time.

WHAT'S THE BEST BRAIN SUPPLEMENT?

I hear this question often. Here's my answer:

#1Live a brain-healthy lifestyle first (Be Brain Fit tells you how).

#2GiveMind Lab Proa try.

This brain supplement meets all 12 of my requirements for a high-quality brain supplement, including effectiveness, safety, purity, and value. So it's easier for you to be mentally sharper, positive, and more productive.

Choosing the right brain supplement is all about quality.See why I recommend Mind Lab Pro.

Dr. Pat

You can strengthen your power to focus by engaging in activities that require intense focus, such as:

You can also use thePomodoro technique.

I use this concentration hack whenever I need to focus.

(I’m using itright nowto write this article.)

First, define clearly what you hope to accomplish.

Next, remove all obvious distractions that are under your control.

Then, set a timer for 25 minutes and, to the best of your ability, give the task at hand your undivided attention.

If your mind wanders, don’t chastise yourself, simply bring it back to your immediate goal.

When the time is up, take a break, then repeat as needed.

By simply focusing on one thing for these 25-minute bursts, you’re training your brain to become better at paying attention.

Steve Jobs, renowned for his ability to focus, memorably explained that“Focusing is about saying no.”

There are a limited number of things you can focus on, so you must rigorously eliminate anything that’s not important.

Practice saying “no.”

So,say “no” to clutter— itaffects your brain’s ability to focusand process information.

Say “no” to buying things you don’t need, energy-draining invitations, and life-sucking relationships.

Say “no” to compulsively checking social media, surfing the web, and texting.

If your electronic devices are running your life, take active measures to take back control.

When you want to focus, create a phone-free zone by putting your phone out of sight and muting it.

Surprisingly,having your smartphone nearby, even if it’s silent, compromises your capacity to focus, problem-solve, and think creatively.

Additionally, you can shut off notifications, uninstall addictive apps, and enable grayscale mode (like the screen on the right in this comparison image), or use a gray scale app.

Most people find that the bleakness of grayscale mode makes their smartphone much less enticing.

As the founder of the Go Gray app observed,“What was bright and shiny is now dull and boring. It’s like turning your favorite dessert into broccoli.”

There are also numerous apps that can help you block distractions, such as:

NUTRITION FOR THE MIND/BODY CONNECTION

It’s almost impossible to live a lifestyle that provides all the nutrients needed for good brain health and performance. The reason? All of us confront multiple nutrient thieves — stress, poor diet, insomnia, pharmaceuticals, pollution, and more — that steal nutrients that the brain needs to thrive.

A foundational principle of mental health and cognitive performance is to supply the body with the best nutrition possible.See why I recommend Performance Lab.

Dr. Pat

When you’ve got a lot on your plate, it’s tempting to work more hours, both at work and at home, to get caught up.

But it’s a well-established fact that working longer hours is counterproductive.

Our current 40-hour workweek is aremnant of the industrial ageand is not the optimal number of hours for productivity.

Research confirms that most people can sustain their focus for justone to four hoursof intense work per day.

Recent experiments with afour-day workweekhave been a great success.

Companies report no loss in productivity, while employees report feeling happier and less stressed.

If you can work fewer hours (i.e., you are self-employed or the boss), do it.

If you don’t have this option, work on your most demanding tasks when you have the most mental energy.

Everyone is different, but for most adults, thismental peak occurs in the late morning.

And, finally, take regular breaks.

Even a mini-break as short as 30 seconds can help you regain your focus.

You may have noticed that short-term stress, such as working under a deadline, temporarily boosts focus.

But it’s not possible to keep this pace up.

Over time,stress takes a toll on brainhealth and function, leading to a shorter attention span, reduced memory, and impaired judgment.

Chronic stressdamages the brain in a number of insidious ways.

It actually causes the brain to prematurely age and lose enough brain cells to measurably shrink.

One of the best techniques to improve focusandreduce stress is meditation.

Meditation puts the brain in thealpha brainwave statewhich enhances focus and concentration, inspires creativity, and induces a state of deep relaxation.

Meditation has definitely become a mainstream practice.

The US Marines have experimented with meditation and found that it helps soldiers stayfocused and calm under pressure.

Major corporations like Google, Aetna, Target, and General Millsencourage their employees to meditate.

These companies realize that employees who meditate are happier, healthier, andless likely to ruminate or be distracted.

The average Americansits nearly 10 hours a day.

All that sitting is making us fat, tired, and sick.

It’s also draining our ability to focus.

You could try using either a standing desk or sit-stand workstation, but that’s not always practical.

Instead, you can follow the20-8-2 rule.

Every half-hour, sit for a maximum of 20 minutes, stand for 8, and move around for 2.

In addition,get regular physical exercisewhich helps you focus, learn, and remember.

John Ratey, MD, author ofSpark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain, is a renowned expert on the effects of exercise on the brain.

He states in hisTEDx Talkthat exercise works as well as attention disorder drugs to focus the mind.

Exercise doesn’t need to be strenuous to be effective.

Walkingis not only one of the best all-around exercises, it clears the mind and helps you think better.

Additionally, exercises that act as moving meditations, such asyoga,tai chi, and qi gong, can appreciably improve focus.

How much physical exercise is enough?

Recent research indicates that a total of2 hours per weekis the minimum you need to stay mentally sharp.

In a perfect world, we’d all have interesting, motivating work that requires creativity and engagement.

But that clearly is not the case.

A whopping68% of us are not engaged at work.

This lack of engagement has a high price, both personally and collectively.

The average worker loses more than 2 hours of productive time every day due to distractions.

This adds up: These interruptions cost the global economy over$450billionper year.

Disengagement occurs when employees feel that their work is boring or not important, or when the project they are working on is overwhelming.

The big-picture solution is to discover, or re-discover, yoursense of purpose at work.

Additionally, breaking large projects down into bite-size chunks can help you stay motivated and engaged.

Each time you finish one of your mini-projects, you get a boost of dopamine, a brain chemical associated with productivity and motivation.

Other surprisingly simple, but proven, ways to increase focus when you’re bored include:

When it comes to the ideal work environment, everyone has their own preferences.

If you find your workspace to be too hot, cold, cluttered, bare, noisy, or quiet, your capacity to focus will suffer.

Take control of your environment as much as you reasonably can.

If you work in a noisy environment, but can’t focus unless it’s quiet, get a good pair of earplugs or noise-canceling headphones.

If it’s appropriate, listen to music.

Listening to music, especially music you enjoyandthat you have chosen, can enhance focus and attention.

Ideally, it should be instrumental music sincelyrics can be distracting.

The music streaming service Spotify has an entire genre of playlists called “Focus” that have been curated to help you do just that.

Another music service,Focus@Will, offers scientifically engineered music channels, based on your personality type, for improving focus.

Focus@Will is used by employees at forward-thinking companies such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and SpaceX.

These playlists work, in part, by altering brainwave activity to boost focus and attention.

Focus@Will’s research indicates that listening to their music channels can quadruple focus and productivity.

A lot of people pride themselves on how little they sleep.

But please, don’t be one of them.

Lack of sleep adversely alters brain cells’ ability to communicate with each other.

This, in turn, impairs focus, memory, mood, and overall mental performance.

According toItzhak Fried, MD, PhD, of the University of California at Los Angeles, lack of sleep affects mental performance as much as being drunk.

A lot goes on in your brain, besides dreaming, while you sleep.

During sleep, your brain is busyforming new brain cells,consolidating the day’s memories, andcleaning,repairing, and reorganizing itself.

It’s not always possible to get the recommended 7 to 9 hours of sleep every night; so when you don’t, take a nap to fill the gap.

Taking a 20-minutepower napin the afternoon is a highly effective way to stay focused, alert, and productive for the rest of the day.

Sara Mednick, PhD, a leading authority on napping and author ofTake a Nap! Change Your Life, discovered that taking a nap keeps productivity higher and longer than consuming caffeine.

The brain is a high-performance organ that needs a disproportionate amount of energy, oxygen, water, and nutrients.

What you eat significantly changes how well your brain performs its many functions, including focus.

For optimal focus, your diet should look more like the Mediterranean “real food” diet and less like the standard American “processed food” diet.

Here are a few dietary suggestions that can significantly improve your ability to focus.

Dietary advice has gotten overly complicated and controversial, but one thing all the experts agree on is that sugar is bad news for mental and physical health.

Sugar negatively affects attention span, mood, and memory.

Itchanges brainwave patterns, making it hard to think clearly.

Sugar fuelsbrain inflammationwhich is linked to poor focus as well as numerous mental health disorders.

Sugar puts blood sugar levels on a roller coaster ride, first up and then down.

Low blood sugar will almost certainly disrupt your focus.

Caffeine is universally consumed for its power to increase focus, alertness, memory, and productivity, but it’s definitely not right for all situations.

If you consume caffeine, you need to be mindful of your dose.

Consuming more than you are accustomed to can leave you a jittery mess, and too little may have your head on your desk — neither extreme will help you focus.

Caffeine can exacerbate stress and trigger symptoms of anxiety.

Itreducesblood flow to the brainwhich, as you might suspect, is not a good thing for brain health and function.

Blood flow delivers oxygen and nutrients that our brain cells need; signs of impaired blood flow to the brain include poor focus and concentration.

If you use caffeine, consume it in moderation and keep your intake roughly the same every day.

Respect caffeine for what it is, a psychoactive drug, and use it judiciously.

Oxygen and water are two overlooked nutrients that are absolutely critical for proper brain function.

Yourbrain is 73% water, and even2% dehydrationcan have a big impact on your ability to focus.

And, while our brain cells clearly need oxygen, many peoplehold their breathwhen concentrating, especially when working on their electronic devices.

This habit, which has been called “email apnea,” can lessen your capacity for focusing and even make you feel lightheaded or dizzy.

Stay well hydrated and remember to breathe deeply from your diaphragm, not from your chest.

Lastly, there are a handful of supplements that contain phytochemicals known to increase focus and concentration.

Some of the best supplements for boosting focus are:

Vitamin B12 is especially important for focus and brain function if you don’t eat meat or frequently take acid-blocking drugs.

Spending time in nature clears the mind and restores our power to focus.

Viewing nature scenes balances the activity of theautonomic nervous system, inducing a state of relaxation.

One hour spentinteracting with naturecan increase attention span and memory by 20%.

If it’s not possible to spend time in nature every day, there are some simple workarounds.

Spend a minute gazing out a window.

One study found thatlooking at a green rooffor only 40 seconds improved concentration and focus.

If you don’t have a view, fill your home or office with houseplants, keep pictures of nature on your desk, or install a wallpaper of natural wonders or landscapes on your computer monitor.

And you don’t have to stick withseeingnature sincelisteningto nature works in much the same way.

Music that includes sounds of natureis especially beneficial for focus and mood.

If you’ve lost your zest for life, can’t focus, and feel unmotivated, you may be low in the neurotransmitter dopamine.

Dopamine is the most important brain chemical for focus, productivity, and motivation.

There are many ways to increase dopamine naturally with food, supplements, and physical exercise.

But one technique for boosting dopamine that also ensures that you get more done isproper goal setting.

If you watch sports, you’ve certainly seen athletes do a celebratory dance or raise their fists in triumph.

A flood of dopamine is responsible for their exuberance.

You can do your own little “victory dance” any time you accomplish a goal.

You can trick your brain into pumping out more of this “motivation molecule” by breaking large goals into many mini-goals.

You’ll get asmall burst of dopamineafter each task is completed.

And each burst of dopamine, in turn, helps you stay focused and motivated.

And finally, there are many underlying physical and mental health conditions that can interfere with brain function and focus.

Anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress, dementia, and, of course, attention disorders can affect your ability to focus.

Medical disordersknown to impair focus include:

Also,many prescription drugsused to treat these and other disorders can negatively impact your focus.

Some of the worst offenders are cholesterol-lowering drugs, prescription sleeping pills, chemotherapy, and drugs that start with “anti,” such as antihistamines or antidepressants.

The “anti” drugs block the action of acetylcholine, a brain chemical responsible for our capacity to focus, learn, and stay mentally alert.

If you suspect that you have an undiagnosed condition or if you take any medications that could be affecting your focus, be sure to bring these issues up with your doctor.

Recommended:Upgrading brain health is key to making your brain work better.

In today's fast-paced and cluttered attention economy, it's becoming increasingly difficult to manage busy workloads and constant distractions to focus at work. But addressing the challenges head-on can render huge benefits to both your productivity and wellbeing.

Notifications, phone calls, texts, housemates, children… these are just a few of the challenges modern workers can face when it comes to trying to focus at work. In fact, a study by theUniversity of California, found that it takes an average of 23 minutes and 15 seconds to regain your focus after being interrupted. It may seem like a small distraction to check your text or answer an email but what may initially feel like 30 seconds or two minutes, breaks up your productivity 23 minutes at a time.

On average, nearly85.5% of people are distracted at work,commonly disturbed by things like emails, phone calls, and the internet. Even the average workerspends 40 secondson a single task before switching to something else. This can actually double the amount of time it takes to complete a single project and is part of the reason you can’t focus at work.

Beyond the way interruptions impact your ability to complete a task, distractions alsosignificantly increase your stress and the number of errorsyou may have in the same assignment.

“If you have to keep up with everything and send emails all the time, there’s no time to reach depth. Depth connected to your work in relationships also takes time…all these things that require depth are suffering.”

Let’s take a look at some of the common causes behind why we struggle to focus at work, and some proven strategies for how to overcome distractions and find focus with ease.

We are conditioned to pay attention to changes in our environment and seek out pleasurable activities. For thousands of years our brains kept track of changes in our environment, alerting us to dangerous predators, potential sources of food, or places to shelter. Our instinctual habit to pay attention to distractions as a life saving tool has become a hinderance on our ability to focus in today’s attention economy.

Neuroscienstis Daniel J. Levitin says it more succinctly in his bookThe Organized Mind, “Our brains evolved to focus on one thing at a time.”In the days of inescapable stimulation, every distraction takes us away from our ability to perform our best withinDeep Work, pushing our cognitive capabilities. Your environment has become one of constant distraction with these five common concerns attributing to your lack of focus:

When stress hormones flood your system they disrupt the normal functioning of neurotransmitters like acetylcholine that are involved in attention and cognitive processing. This leads to decreased mental clarity, increased distractibility, and impaired memory retention.

When the boundaries between your professional and personal life blur, it can prove challenging to stay focused at work. Dopamine is a proven aid to focus, which means your emotional state will often be directly tied to your ability to concentrate. When your mental health is not at its peak, it can generate mental clutter, preoccupy your thoughts, and make it extremely challenging to attend to work-related tasks.

Contrary to popular belief, multitasking impedes your productivity. When you switch between tasks rapidly, your brain needs time to refocus and adjust, causing a loss of concentration and preventing you from fully engaging with each task. This dividing of attention results in mental fatigue, and reduces your ability to focus, which in turn can severely compromise the quality of your output.

The constant bombardment of emails, social media notifications, and the ever present lure of doom scrolling can pull you away from your intended task and contribute to your lack of focus. The quiet ping of a notification or the burst of color from a banner disrupts your attention, resulting in a creeping “attention residue.”

When you lack enthusiasm or motivation toward your work, procrastination can soon follow. It then becomes harder to concentrate and sustain focus. When facing unpleasant projects, the task may actually cause you pain, keeping you from taking action.

The thought of performing a task you don’t want to do can produce the same effect in your brain as the threat of pain, equal to holding your hand against a scalding coffee cup. In a2020 study at McGill University, the average person chose pain over a difficult mental task 28% of the time.

What is deep work? Your easy-to-digest guide

The consequences of struggling with focus at work extend beyond any immediate setbacks. When facing persistent focus challenges, you may experience the following:

Reduced Productivity: The inability to maintain focus leads to decreased output, longer completion times, and missed deadlines.

Diminished Work Quality: Lack of concentration can result in errors, oversights, and lower quality work, impacting overall performance.

Missed Opportunities: Failure to stay focused may cause you to miss out on critical information, collaboration opportunities, and career advancements.

Enhancing productivity starts with sharpening your focus. Let’s take a look at ten proven strategies designed to help with this, so that you can boost your concentration and achieve optimal work performance.

By breaking your work tasks down into manageable stints, you can lessen the stress of work projects and stir your motivation. The Pomodoro technique is a time blocking tool that’s great for this. This method breaks work into 25-minute intervals of focused work followed by 5-minute breaks.

Time blocking in general allows you to mark out times of day to focus on specific tasks. This added structure and planning not only helps you sustain your momentum, but also helps in developing more awareness of how long tasks take so that you can build a more organized and efficient approach to your work day.

Incorporatemindfulness practices like meditationto cultivate focus, reduce stress, and enhance cognitive abilities. Systematically scan and observe different parts of your body by noticing the sensations or tension in your feet, heels, ankles, and moving upwards until reaching the top of your head.

Find a quiet and safe place towalk, either indoors or outdoors, while paying attention to your movement and breathing. Walking without distractions from technology make you more aware of your surroundings, your body’s motion, and your overall mental awareness. It can boost your mood and your energy levels in the short and long term.

The exercises help you practice concentration that you can bring back to your work. Mindfulness exercises help to train your attention, which in turn can enhance emotional regulation and promote calmer states of mind.

Find an accountability partner or use the concept of "body doubling" to create a supportive environment where you work in the presence of another person to support your ability to stay focused and gain a sense of accountability

Create a schedule, discuss whether you will work in person or virtually, and share what you intend to work on. The combination of social reinforcement, external responsibility, and sense of structure can become an effective way to improve your focus and productivity.

FLOWN runs virtual coworking sessions where you can experience the benefits of the body doubling effect wherever you are, and whenever you need

Minimize distractions by decluttering your workspace, turning off notifications, and creating a dedicated, organized area conducive to concentration.An optimal work environmentis not just where you approach work but also what encourages you to focus.

Optimizing your work environment is all about improving focus and productivity.The Science Behind FLOWNsupports the importance of a sense of control in your life, whether environmental or actionable. An optimized work enviroment gives you the action of organization and cleaning, as well as providing a clear, space in which to complete your tasks.

What should I do if I feel stuck in my career?



To Anyone Feeling Stuck Right Now - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdZ_tE911c

Transcript:
(00:01) - [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers. Welcome back. Do you feel lost or stuck in life? It's normal to feel uncertain sometimes, like you've run into a wall and have no idea where to go next. Perhaps you're feeling tired of the everyday hustle. Maybe you're faced with a huge life-changing decision or you could just be experiencing some good-old burnout.
(00:21) Feeling stuck often comes with feelings of dissatisfaction with where you're at in life, demotivation, discomfort, and doubtfulness. These complex and often confusing emotions can take away the enthusiasm of waking up to a new day every morning and make you feel like you've lost your purpose or direction in life.
(00:39) So if you've been feeling stuck lately, know that you are not alone in feeling this way. And that there may be some things you can try to help you move forward again. Number one, be proactive instead of passive. It can be easy to feel stuck when you're passively watching your life go by instead of actively doing your best to take control of it.
(00:59) Although it may feel easier to sit with this uncertainty. Doing so is not quite the solution to overcome it. Escaping this trapped feeling can only come if you put in the necessary efforts to improve the necessary areas in your life. When you feel stuck, put yourself in the driver's seat where you truly belong.
(01:16) Ultimately, the first step to overcoming feeling stuck in life is to have the willpower to establish sustainable changes and goals, which can give you the motivation to get that engine started again. Number two, let go of your inner fears and limitations. Have your fears stopped you from pursuing what you really want? Whether it's a fear of failure, never-ending chase for perfection, or a need to be validated by others to feel worthy, these fears and limitations can be overwhelming and get in the way of your plans and goals.
(01:48) This is why it's important that you identify and confront these setbacks so you can come to understand where they come from and how you get over them. Letting go of your inner fears and limitations, no matter how big or how small they may be can help greatly empower you to be able to reach for your true desires in life.
(02:06) Number three, stay true to yourself. Are you living your life for others instead of yourself? This can especially happen if you're taking on too many responsibilities. Perhaps you're taking up a job for the title, instead of the experience, studying something your family wanted you to do or being dragged to events or activities you have no personal interest in.
(02:26) If you find yourself feeling trapped doing things that feel uninteresting and more like a waste of time, it may be time for you to prioritize what is most important to you. This may mean reflecting on your values, your goals and your desires, and determining the areas in your life that are not necessarily helping you stay true to them.
(02:46) Number four, change things up a bit. Are you tired of waking up to the same old schedule every day? Clinical psychologist and author, Lisa Firestone, states in her article with Psychology Today that this is because when we fall into a routine, we're often choosing a pattern of behavior that feels self-proactive and familiar.
(03:06) To protect ourselves from anxiety and pain, we subconsciously design a set of structured behaviors to help us navigate the world. So introducing new activities or reinventing your regular schedule can serve a great deal in reviving and refreshing your mindset. The little changes you make to your routine can add up to a big difference over time.
(03:25) This could be as simple as putting your phone away to enjoy some quality time with your family, taking a different route on your way to work or waking up five minutes earlier to practice some mindful meditation in the morning. And number five, create an action plan. Last, but most importantly, create a solid action plan.
(03:44) When you feel like you're running into a wall in one aspect of your life, you have other aspects or areas in your life, which you do have control of, at least to some extent. Five yourself something to look forward to by creating a personalized goal system that can accommodate your needs and desires so you can continue to grow and develop in a positive way.
(04:03) And when you set your goals, you could try following the SMART goal setting so that your goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely. This gives you a much higher chance in successfully accomplishing them. And allowing yourself time to find your natural flow again is important. Life has its many unpredictable ups and downs but you can still continue to do your part and staying to stay a couple of steps ahead of the game with some strong goal setting skills.

Everyone goes through this phase of uncertainty and confusion at some point in their life. Just remember that change does not happen overnight but over time.

My Career Advice For Anyone Feeling Stuck In Life - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) looking back I totally wasted my 20s I had no one in my early 20s speaking anything positive or beneficial to me when they say to choose your friends wisely they're not lying I worked in a restaurant for a few years alongside a part-time radio gig then I got married and I stepped up into a data entry rle at lap Corp entering data via a number pad no there were no letters it was just a square number pad and there was a stack of drug tests and I just flipped through it and punch in the numbers for 8 hours then I went on to working in a
(00:27) medical transcription department for the next 10 years now the problem with this approach to life is that if you're ever faced with the unfortunate circumstances of being laid off you will realize that you were left void of any skill set to move forward with you don't have any particular place to go after that if you're in a job that's not specialized and really anyone can do it and you stay there for too long and you move up the ladder when your days are over there you have nowhere to go you have no specific
(00:53) skill set or experience to shift into something later I didn't go to school for anything particular I worked jobs that could be replaced easily and when they announced that they were laying off our entire department except my boss and I then I knew my days were numbered now in all this my wife was my biggest asset she kept telling me hey you're fixing everyone's computers in the office you spend a lot of time on computers at home why don't you do some training in computers or programming and she said
(01:17) this multiple times over those years but I worked around very unambitious people 8 hours a day and just thought it was impossible looking back she was right all along but that's another story so in those latter years in that job I started reading I started started studying I learned to write code and I got into software development in the whole story all of the details are found in this video so I won't repeat that here but be sure to go watch that if you're interested but the turning point for me
(01:40) in coming to the realization that I can move forward with work in computers is largely based on a diagram that I came across a diagram that radically changed my mindset on what I should be doing with my life and when I talk to anyone in a similar situation especially people in their early 20s who have no clue what to do with their lives what their calling is how to make money how to build a career that's in demand I now Point them to this resource and I initially came across it in a blog post Years Ago by Michael hayatt and I don't
(02:07) think this blog post exists anymore but the diagram does and you may have seen this before but I'm not sure you've really investigated all of the questions that this diagram answers so let me explain it to you so there are three key items here that help you determine your calling and all three components have to be here if not you'll either hate your job you'll be broke or you'll forever be in and out of work one of those three and before I explain this I do want to mention the launch of my weekly
(02:30) newsletter that kicked off last week if you're looking for a summary of the latest programming and Tech news AI updates or insights into the latest tech job markets or you just want to be an informed developer be sure to give it a subscribe I think you'll love it link below so there's three key items here listen closely first there's passion everyone has something they're passionate about computers business finances building things debating caring for people whatever it is every person has activities that fire them up it's
(02:57) what excites them it's what makes them tick the problem though is that passion alone doesn't pay if I'm passionate about collecting baseball cards that's great but it probably won't put me in any successful career in addition if you aren't passionate about something over time you'll begin to hate what you do sure it may pay good and sure you might be good at it but if you hate what you do every day what good is the job second is proficiency what are you good at as my wife kept telling me I was good at
(03:21) all things computers I was also passionate about it but both of these are not always the case many people are good at things that they hate doing when you're good at something people always come to you and if you hate doing it you'll be like ah not again there's an auto mechanic in my area that's really good at what he does but he complains non-stop every time you go in there it's just negativity and Dread but on the other hand if you're passionate about something but not at all good at it you
(03:44) won't succeed either and then finally and it's all going to come together here there's profitability is the career a profitable career if you have that passion for collecting baseball cards and you're proficient and you know all the ins and outs of all the years and Brands but you can't make money doing it then it's not a good Pursuit and this is actually called a hobby so if you have a passion say serving people and helping people get well and you're proficient at it say you went to nursing school and
(04:07) you passed with flying colors then you need to check if it's profitable and nursing pays good because they're always in demand check all three are there but if any one of these three things are lacking then probably it isn't a wise and good calling that fits you longterm sure you may work jobs here and there over the years and that's fine passion can come later over the importance of a paycheck and let me be clear being a hard worker a person who is productive and honest and all that goes a long way
(04:34) many of us work jobs we hate for a while to pay the bills that's a good thing passion is an end goal and can come later but you eventually want to reach this intersection where you have passion for what you do you're good at what you do and it's a profitable industry it's in demand if you have the passion for something and you're good at it but it's not a profitable career or sector to get into you'll be poor if you have the passion for something and it pays good but you suck at it you'll be fired and
(04:58) poor and if you're good at something it pays well but you hate what you do every single day of your life then you'll just be a miserable person so where are you at today think about these three things first what are you good at ask people often it's glaringly obvious to everyone but you so ask people and then put a list together of some things that you're good at second what do you love doing what excites you when you get to work on it what topics excite you maybe it's something that you haven't done in a
(05:22) long time but always have had in the back of your mind again make a list of a few of these things finally take these two lists and cross off the things that aren't profitable for me I loved computers I was good at computers and actually this goes way back to high school and it took me forever to realize it and then finally the role of software developer is a profitable career it pays good so here I am in my vocational calling can this change sure I mean here I am talking to you on YouTube in fact given the leverage that the worldwide
(05:50) web gives you in 2024 and Beyond there are boundless opportunities out there crazy I actually had a comment recently taking offense to me saying that there are endless opportunities people like this they're going nowhere and they want to see everyone else fail as well such as the nature of negative people and this sort of diagram can help you in many walks of life let me give you two examples first think about college degrees let's say you love theater you're good at it and you go to college for it to then get out with a ton of
(06:17) debt and no market for that sort of thing that's just a hobby or take graphic design or fashion design art photography tourism degrees you may love these hobbies and interests and are wise and knowledgeable about them but there's no market so just following this chart can save you tons of money in college debt alone and here's a second example this diagram actually can be altered to help you figure out many other things in life I saw this one just the other day same kind of chart on how to determine
(06:43) what video to create so you have what you want to create what your viewers want and then what others are creating find that middle ground there and create those videos but back to this original diagram where are you at in this chart have you found the calling that covers all three of these areas yet if so full steam ahead if not let me know down in the comments what's stopping you I always love reading them if you found this video helpful give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel consider doing so and I'll see you in
(07:10) the next video [Music]

Don't settle for feeling stuck in your career.

According to astudy by Oracle, more than 75% of people feel “stuck” personally and professionally. There are a wide variety of reasons you might feel stuck in your career. Maybe you’ve worked in the technology industry for years when you don’t even have a passion for it. Or you’ve remained at the same company for decades because the pay and benefits are great, yet the work doesn’t energize you. As time goes on, those “golden handcuffs” slowly tighten. You may even feel like something is missing or holding you back from having greater satisfaction. If you’ve been struggling with the feeling of beingstuck in your careerfor a while, it’s a sign that it’s time to do something about it.

Yet, change is always difficult, even if it’s for the better. That’s because humans don’t like uncertainty. We’re hardwired for survival and prefer to know what’s coming next. Over time, too much uncertainty causes anxiety and eventually turns into full-blown fear. But uncertainty can be redefined to work in your favor. As Eckhart Tolle wrote in his book,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose,“If uncertainty is unacceptable to you, it turns into fear. If it is perfectly acceptable, it turns into increased aliveness, alertness, and creativity.”

You need to make a critical decision. Do you want to settle for the life you have now or take action to create the life you deserve? If you’re ready to break free, here are 10 ways to stop feeling stuck in your career.

One of the first things you should do is determinewhyyou feel stuck in your career. Is it because you always seem to be passed over for a promotion? Or maybe your salary and benefits are so attractive that you find it hard to leave—even though you don’t feel challenged. Whatever the case, do some soul-searching, so you understand what is potentially lacking in your life.

People are happier when their value system aligns with their careers. In fact, job satisfaction is determined more by how your values align with your work environment than by any other factor. Therefore, it is important to analyze your work values to clarify your priorities.

Most people start from where they are and think, what can I do with the skills I have? That line of thinking only gives you a narrow view. Instead, open your mind to the possibilities. Focus on your transferrable skills. Also, don’t start from where you are. Start from where youwantto be. Where do you see yourself? Is there a profession you’ve been longing to try for years? What are the things that you are good at and that you enjoy? That’s the sweet spot.

When you feel stuck in your career, it helps to envision what you’d like your life to look like. Take at least 30 minutes to complete this exercise in a quiet space. Imagine yourself blissfully happy at the age of 90, looking back over your ideal career. What does it look like? What have you achieved? What are you feeling? Write down as much detail as you can. This exercise will help you connect with yourself and what you truly want.

Many of us label experiences as “failures" instead of "stepping stones." Yet, what you perceive to be failures in the moment, could lead you to your greatest success. Think of it as a detour in your journey rather than a roadblock.

No one gets through a transitional period without support. This is the time to lean into your significant other, friends, family, colleagues and mentors. You might also consider hiring a career coach who can provide an unbiased professional perspective.

When you feel stuck, chances are you’ve been involved in the same activity for a while. It’s time to change things up.Planned serendipityis a practical skill. Push yourself to try new things. Take up a new hobby. Enroll in that photography class you’ve been interested in. Put yourself in unfamiliar situations to engage with previously unknown individuals and ideas. That way, you give new people and information the chance to enter your life.

Apart from getting help and embracing new experiences, just get out there! Feeling stuck means, you're not inspired to change.Motivational speaker Jim Rohnsays we are the average of the five people we spend the most time with. Whom you associate with influences your outlook. For example, if you spend time with "energy vampires," you'll experience low energy. On the other hand, if you decide to engage with people whom you want to emulate, you'll feel much more inspired. Plus, you’ll be expanding your network at the same time.

Micro habits are small actions you can take daily to see significant results. It’s a better way to tackle big goals because you’ll be less likely to get discouraged. For example, if you want to expand your network, decide to reach out to 10 people each day. Then over time, increase that number to 20 people daily. Pretty soon, it will become part of your routine.

Getting unstuck requires patience and intention. It’s something that is done little by little. Just know that it’s a gradual process. The most important thing is not to give up.

Let's face it. Change is the only thing we can truly count on. By embracing the unknown, you’ll open the door to a whole new realm of possibilities.

How can I handle stress from exams?


How I Overcame Crippling Anxiety about My Grades - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0Fa24dqTvA

Transcript:
(00:00) every time anxiety or stress takes over i snap my fingers and the feeling disappears yeah i wish it worked like that but it doesn't oh wait come on i've always struggled with anxious thoughts so much to the point where i can't be present with anything i couldn't study i couldn't enjoy hanging out with friends i couldn't even take a dump in peace without thinking how screwed i am for this exam anxiety had taken control of my life and i needed answers so let me take you into my mind and share the
(00:27) journey i've gone through with managing my anxiety what's interesting is that anxiety isn't bad self-anxiety is actually healthy it means we care about stuff like thousands of years ago people had to worry about being eaten by hyenas or lions real life or death [ __ ] anxiety helps us take precautions we don't fall prey to those situations nowadays those worries are mostly gone but our mind didn't get the memo it's still programmed to be on high alert for danger and so it searches for anything
(00:54) it can worry about in our day to day lives but what could possibly be so dangerous about going to school so for me back when i was a dumb space cadet medical student i had anxiety about falling behind or failing exams which would crush my chances of matching into a residency program i was always overthinking about how am i going to impress dr ken really my anxiety made me fearful like if i wasn't studying 24 7 or staying late every day after work then i was going to fail and my life was going to be miserable looking back on it
(01:24) now i realized that stress and anxiety forced me to do things that i would never ever do it literally blinded me like in medical school we learn about the importance of things like sleep diet exercise for our health yet here i was pulling an all-nighter studying about sleep deprivation because i was so anxious about my exam there's this funny saying that doctors make the worst patients and i'm no exception and in that moment i started to think deeply about my own anxiety and i came to some interesting realizations
(01:55) the first thing i learned about anxiety is that it's always about the future something that hadn't happened yet but might and you might think wait a second that's not true i have anxiety about things in the past all the time yes but no i can have anxiety about something that happened in the past but if i really thought about it the anxiety is actually about the consequences of what could happen in the future like i remember after a day on my surgery rotation my attending pimped my nuts off and i completely dropped the ball
(02:24) basically looked like a complete idiot in front of the entire team and before i went to bed later that night i was stuck replaying this thought loop about what had happened but the anxiety wasn't about that incident it was about how they might see me as an idiot failure the next time that we work together in the future and knowing that led me to understand something else about the inescapable nature of anxiety it doesn't go away until that situation happens i'll be anxious about my exam until i take it i'll be anxious about my
(02:54) application until i hear back about an interview it doesn't matter how prepared i was well actually that's not true let me take that back it helped if i was a bit more prepared but it didn't disappear my anxious mind was always lurking you know in the comments section right when i thought i felt secure and confident it'd show up and make me question everything about my reality about what is life about who gon freaks his mother really is i thought i was finally starting to make some progress in understanding what my anxious
(03:22) thoughts were about and the pattern of how they came and went but i also knew i couldn't be the only student who struggled with anxiety so i had to look into the research studies have shown that medical students are some of the most neurotic types of students out there and it's that neuroticism that causes the most psychological stress and burnout high levels of neuroticism have been linked to things like experiencing negative emotions or emotional instability distress moodiness irritability and on top of that more
(03:49) than 75 percent of anxiety and depressive disorders are diagnosed before the age of 30 which means our coming of age years you know students when we figure out what we want to do and how to navigate our life are super important those years can quite literally make or break our mental health all this reading made me realize that i needed to do more than just sit down and think about my anxiety so i did what i do best no not procrastinate well maybe a little bit self-experimentation first up was to distract myself sounds easy enough i
(04:23) stomp some noobs let's go dude let's go let's go i pumped some serious iron i began one piece i learned how to prepare a perfect steak in theory it seemed like it was working at first while i was distracting myself i wasn't thinking about my anxiety at all but it was short-lived the problem was when i stopped distracting myself those thoughts just came flooding back often even worse than before my mind was like a pressure valve i could distract myself from thinking about it but that meant they were just building up not a
(04:52) perfect solution so i moved on the runner-up idea was to avoid it completely if you can't beat it run from it right that's how the saying goes i stopped studying i stopped asking questions i stopped trying to kiss ass that seemed to work for a couple days but just like with the distraction idea this again only ended up making my anxiety worse because in addition to having the anxiety i had before about those things now i also had the anxiety about being aloof or insecure and that i was being a huge [ __ ] avoiding my anxiety triggers
(05:26) completely contradicted what i had to do in order to achieve my goals like i can't not study for my exams or not go to work that was not gonna help me become a doctor i don't know what i was expecting with that plan like when do we ever hear in movies yeah the best way to tackle your problems is to just run away from them which led me to my final proposed solution fight it every time my lurking anxiety made its way to the front of my mind i put on my mean face i squared up and gave it a big old punch to the ear
(05:56) mother hit me in the ear i shut it down and guess what yeah it didn't work either because in a fight there's usually opposition and my anxiety packed a way bigger punch than the one that i threw fighting against my anxiety only caused me more anxiety because regardless of how much i tried to suppress it or power through it it always came back stronger and that frustration would snowball and build on itself i was already stressing out about school and now i was also feeling stressed about failing to control my stress about school it was
(06:32) stress stacking on stress at this point i was feeling pretty defeated i know i'm an overthinker but this was insane how do we overcome this endless onslaught of anxiety and stress even when we think we understand what we're anxious about so i was struggling one day at work when one of the psych residents i worked with pulled me aside and asked if i was okay and i just broke down i basically trauma dumped everything that i was going through how i felt about school the pressure i felt from my parents my peers
(07:04) even myself just to keep going and keep pushing the fear of failure and the fear of ending up miserable and i'll never forget the look that she gave me it was sad hopeful and comforting all at the same time she went on to tell me that almost everyone feels this type of way about some aspect of their life but then she dropped this pearl that truly resonated with me and shifted my entire approach to managing anxiety don't forget to be grateful for what you've done i sat with that line for a long time trying to make sense of it and i
(07:38) realized that i was approaching my anxiety from the wrong angle what we need to do is get comfortable being uncomfortable and sit with our anxiety and a way that we can do that is by being grateful to ourselves a lot of times we know how to treat other people we're empaths you know who can place ourselves in the shoes of others to understand how to comfort our friends and family members when they're in a time of need but for some strange reason we often don't know how to be empathetic to ourselves we don't treat ourselves
(08:08) like we do our six-year-old brother but if we do we're then able to redirect that anxiety and then appreciate all the progress that we've made so after pondering over this i began applying different mental models into my life to practice sitting with anxiety and i broke it all down into a simple two-step process anytime anxiety arises step one is to remember that every reaction to anxiety is a choice regardless of what our anxiety is about or how it makes us feel we need to remember that we have a choice about how we want to respond to
(08:39) it no matter how badly i freak out about my upcoming exams or worry about looking dumb in front of my attending i just have to catch myself before i act and remember that i'm in control and i have a choice to make i can act impulsively out of fear and do something stupid or i can choose to sit with it and step 2 choose gratitude choose to be appreciative of how much you've learned how much you've grown and how far you've come big exams will always cause me anxiety but i should choose to be grateful for how much work i've already
(09:09) put in studying i should choose to be grateful for the fact that i'm even thinking about my anxiety the way that i am you know for proactively looking for solutions to better manage my emotions being grateful allows us to self-reflect on the facts the tangible evidence that we're not eternally screwed like our anxiety wants us to believe that's what's been working for me to calm down my nerves i found that by choosing gratitude i was able to sit with my anxiety much better being grateful would
(09:36) help dissolve my anxiety so that i could get out of my own head and regain control over my mind i think we need to reframe how we think about anxiety it's not a handicap it's just our brain's way of protecting us from making dangerous and dumb decisions we just have to remember that we're always going to encounter stress throughout our lives but at the end of the day we always have a choice we can choose to implode and make an impulsive emotional decision based on fear or we can choose to accept
(10:03) that our mind doesn't always know what's best and one of the best approaches is to learn to sit with our anxiety and choose to be better so let me know what do you guys do to deal with your anxiety and if you try out this method let us know if it worked for you

Transcript:
(00:00) So many of you have exams going on, many are coming and you are feeling a lot of tension, why is Kahani getting a little less tension, Kahani is getting a little more tension and perhaps the reason for this could be that you  I have not studied enough. Just three days ago, my friend posted a status on WhatsApp in which it was said that one of his friends had committed suicide just a day before the exam.
(00:21)  Many times there is so much pressure on our mind, there is such terrible tension.  I do n't understand what is happening with us and let me tell you in advance that I was one of those students who do not suffer from tension but have hypertension. Hello friends, I am Deepak Dahiya and today I came in front of the camera and made a video.  I am doing this so that you all connect with me more.
(00:39)  2 years ago, I had already decided that I will definitely make a video in a studio. The pressure and tension that comes one or two days before the exam, I am not sure how to handle it. Also half a minute mistake was the exam and what happened at the time of 12th exam, you all would know that if you have watched my video with Sandeep sir, then you all would know that everything had happened just before this paper, just before the paper.
(01:00)   First the equation had changed, I last dreamed of me the day before yesterday and after that there was the exam of most two subjects. Many students are like this. The pressure of jeans exam is the same which cannot be handled. The brain cycle goes away. There are many such people.  There are people whose mind gets shaken after a breakup, we do n't understand completely what is happening inside us, such an illusion of emotions comes and goes in our body, all the negative emotions come together and come only to reduce the mood.  It helps in reducing the body,
(01:32) what kind of cucumber was it, what is happening with us, so you imagine, on one hand, exam pressure and a lot of tension, because my preparation in Maths was a little less than what I should have done, it was exactly as much as I should have been.  I was not at the top, I liked maths and I missed it. My preparation was less and I was feeling very stressed.
(01:49) After that, I got the biggest pen and the pain that is created by mixing these two pens, I felt that pain. She lifted me up and tolerated it. Whenever I was having both the pains together and on top of all the exams, I was feeling very stressed, then I thought that I will definitely make this video so that if there are people in my condition who only have exams.
(02:10)   May he get some relief after watching my video. May his  heart get some relief because at that time there was no video on this topic. I searched all over YouTube and did not find any video so that my heart could get some relief.  May I feel relaxed, may my worries be reduced, there was no video but today's video will reduce your worries a little, this  video will take a piece of your mind and give you peace.
(02:34)  First of all, let us talk about the tension that we have about exams.  Why does that happen, the practical reason for it, the correct reason, I will tell you the reason for this is that we do not have an image in the mind of all the people that 80% of it will be made, at least 90% of it will be made. Then it is not possible that in the eyes of people this image has become our caste and when our preparation is not according to the image, that means the whole world is expecting from us and we ourselves were also expecting that 90% of my  We will get it but
(03:01) our preparation is just before the exam. When the exam is about to come, we feel that our preparation was not enough to get it and when it is released, we feel that we will not live up to people's expectations.  Only then will we be able to remove it, we feel tension, that's why I feel tension, I was also worried about the fact that I did not have an image in the eyes of the people that I will get very good percentage in this, 80% further 85 90, so I crossed it easily and felt relaxed.  It will be done but
(03:24) I was very bad in Maths. The biggest reason for exam tension is that the expectations of people are heavy on us. The first thing you have to keep in mind is that if you have studied then Then there is no need to take any tension because the result is in your hands, you have given your best, you have done as much as you can, and even if the result is less than your expectation, it is okay because you  If you had left no stone unturned in the preparation, then there is absolutely no need to take tension here and if you are taking tension, then
(03:55) in the coming time you will come to know that the tension you were taking was foolishness at best. What could be bigger, let us see that no one expected you to fail and if you failed in a particular subject then what happened if you failed then there would be some people who would stay in the aquarium for a few days.
(04:11)   We will talk about the fact that today he failed, for some days you will have that feeling that he has failed in his class, he has failed in his subject, it will  remain in your mind for some years, but at some point of time, not everyone will forget this thing.  No one will remember what percentage you had, when you failed in your subject, when you topped, no one will remember if you did  not get the percentage you expected, if you could not get the college of your choice, if your mother wishes.  Even if you don't get it, will
(04:39) life stop, it won't stop at all and remember one thing that anything happens in nature, it happens to someone for some reason, so even if you fail, you do n't get your stage, college, when you want.  You don't get everything for some reason, you just have to understand that God wants to make us better, that's why he did n't make us what we wanted to be.
(05:01)  Any single exam, your character, your personality, decide your life, decide your future.  No power, no exam paper has the right to decide your life and there are some people who commit suicide just because of the tension of one exam paper, they end their entire life and do not want to waste their life.
(05:17)   Isn't it, life has to end, this is a small part of life, it is possible that it will not make any difference in your life, it will not make any difference, in future you will feel that I was just taking tension about it. So there was no role in my life, why was I not taking tension? You laugh at your tension, when you are taking it now, then if you already know that you will laugh later too, then there is no need to take tension.
(05:37) Also, the problem is not as big as we make it by thinking about it again and again. In reality, the problem is very small, in our mind we make it a big problem and the biggest thing is that perhaps you are not in my condition.  It may be that on one hand you are facing terrible exam tension, there is a lot of tension and on the other hand, your dream is the day after tomorrow.
(05:54)  I have left you and gone just before the exam and before the top paper of the exam. I hope that you are not in the same condition.  Because I tolerated that condition, I moved ahead and did something good in my life, after that, Swami, I am telling you this situation with a smile, so after taking him out of the situation, I am telling you here in this situation.
(06:14)   I am telling you laughingly, so if this is yours, then you too will be more happy than me. In the future, no matter what happens in life, you will remain alive. So this was today's video. Apart from this, if  If you have any personal problem, you can message me on Instagram, Shakti Ho, these are both my IDCs, we put motivational content on this and this is my personal page, so you can message me here also, follow me, whatever you want.
(06:35)   If you have a personal problem, you can share it with me here and if you are comfortable with sharing it in the comment area, you can also tell me by commenting in the comment area. I will try my best to read the comment and solve your problem.  And if any of your friends or relatives are under a lot of tension like exams are going on, then help them too.
(06:51)  By watching this video, maybe their tension will reduce a little and their heart will also feel better.  If you get peace then this is all in this video. See you again in the next video. Till then Jai Hind Jai Bharat.

The experience of exam stress is something we all share before, during, and even after exams. Despite thorough preparation, thereâs a twinge of anxiety that often creeps in with questions like, "Have I covered everything?" or, "What if I can't recall these important points?" This shared experience ties together students and a myriad of others, all facing stress during significant exams or tests. While exam stress in students is completely normal, the pressure to perform well can lead to anxiety, decreased focus, and sometimes evenburnout. Moreover, it can take a toll on oneâs mental and physical well-being.

â

From mindful preparation and organized study schedules to physical activities and relaxation techniques, here are a range of strategies that can help you navigate challenging exam periods with a greater sense of calm and confidence.

â

â

Before diving into your study session, ensure you have all the essential materials and resources at hand. Break down your study materials into smaller, manageable segments and assign dedicated time slots to tackle each one. Having a structured plan can make studying feel more manageable and reduce last-minute cramming. As an alternative, you could also experiment withtime management methodsto make your study sessions more productive.

â

â

Consider utilizing digital tools or apps for better organization. For example, apps likeTrelloorNotioncan help you create detailed study schedules and track your progress. These tools can also facilitate collaboration with tutors or study groups, enhancing the efficiency of your preparation.

â

Integrate awareness exercises such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation to enhance your daily routine. These methods will effectively soothe your mind, ease test anxiety, and improve your overall focus. For instance, theMindfulness appon your Apple Watch can help you set aside a few minutes a day to focus on deep breathing, which could lower blood pressure and stress levels significantly.

â

Moreover, prioritize getting sufficient sleep to ensure that your brain functions optimally during both study sessions and exams.

â

â

Establish a pre-study relaxation routine to signal your brain that it's time to focus. This could include a short meditation session, stretching exercises, or a few minutes of mindfulness. A consistent routine helps train your mind to transition smoothly into study mode.

â

As rightly put by the saying, "You are what you eat," a well-balanced diet plays a crucial role in reducing exam stress. Nourish yourself with mind-enhancing foods like nuts, seeds, and leafy greens. While caffeine undoubtedly heightens alertness and concentration, scientific evidence has proven its potential to disrupt sleep patterns and trigger irritability. Choose more wholesome foods such as herbal teas and fruits to foster well-being.

â

â

Prepare a list of healthy snacks and keep them handy during study sessions. Foods like berries, yogurt, and whole-grain crackers provide sustained energy and focus. Avoid heavy or sugary snacks that can cause energy crashes and distract you from studying.

â

A healthy body lays the foundation for a sound mind. Engaging in daily physical activity naturally reduces exam stress. Make regular exercise a part of your routine, whether through jogging, yoga, or following a quick workout plan. Exercise stimulates the release of endorphins, which are known for their mood-enhancing and stress-reducing properties.

â

â

Integrate short exercise breaks into your study schedule. Even a5-10 minute brisk walkor a quick yoga session can rejuvenate your mind and body, helping you return to your studies with renewed energy and focus.

â

While social media platforms and smartphones are great sources of entertainment, they also prove to be one of the biggest sources of distraction, especially during stressful periods like exams. Moreover, research indicates that excessive phone usage and extensive engagement with social media can adversely affect your mental health.

â

To maintain a healthier technological relationship and better mental well-being, set limits on your screen time, take breaks from social media, and participate in other stress-relief activities, especially during exam periods.

â

â

Designate a specific area for studying that is free from distractions. Keep your study space organized and technology-free if possible. This will help your brain associate that space with focus and productivity, enhancing your study effectiveness.

â

While engaging in discussions can act as an effective method to understand difficult concepts and revise information with your peers, at times, it can also imply that the material or resources your friend has covered might still be unfamiliar to you. This situation can potentially contribute to the stress of having a backlog of topics yet to be explored by you. It's important to keep in mind that each individual learns at a pace and in astyle that suits them best, and staying true to your own learning pace and style will help you achieve better results.

â

â

Participate in study groups strategically. Choose groups where you can review and reinforce your understanding rather than comparing progress. This approach ensures that group study sessions remain supportive rather than stress-inducing.

â

Effectivelearning strategiescan significantly reduce the stress associated with exams, enhance your preparation, and boost your confidence.

â

Methods like the blurting technique, the Feynman approach, the Leitner system, and more, stand as examples. Always remember that consistency is key; finding the perfect blend of strategies that align with your strengths will definitely contribute to achieving successful outcomes.

â

â

Incorporate various learning tools such as flashcards, educational apps, or interactive simulations. These tools can cater to different learning styles and help reinforce key concepts in a more engaging and effective manner.

â

â

The points mentioned above are quite mainstream and familiar; in fact, Iâm sure youâve tried most of them, but there are some other interesting ways to significantly reduce exam tension or stress. They all share a common factor, which ironically, involves not thinking about the looming pressure of exams, at least for a while. Here are some creative suggestions that can help you manage exam stress:

â

â

Just as Professor Lupin offers Harry Potter chocolate after facing a dementor (exams can be as scary as one!), eating chocolate, especially a dark one, can help with exam stress.Â Â

â

â

Research shows that eating dark chocolate reduces stress hormones and boosts memory significantly. Dark chocolate might have an impact on stress hormones like cortisol, potentially leading to a temporary reduction in stress levels. However, the benefits of dark chocolate are generally thought to be most significant when it is consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet.

â

Opt for dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa content for maximum benefits. This type of chocolate contains higher levels of antioxidants and compounds that can help alleviate stress. Enjoy it as a small treat rather than a regular indulgence.

â

Immerse yourself in activities that bring you solace, such as writing down your thoughts,journaling, playing a soothingmusical instrument, singing, or perhaps painting. Engaging in things you enjoy and are passionate about can create numerous positive effects on your mental and emotional well-being, helping to manage and reduce exam stress in the process.

â

Dedicate a specific time each day for creative activities. Whether it's drawing, writing, or playing music, regularly engaging in these activities can serve as a productive outlet for stress and a break from academic pressures.

â

VR experiencescan offer a way to distract yourself and escape from the real world. Immersing yourself in a captivating VR environment can divert your attention from stressors and negative thoughts, allowing you to concentrate on something enjoyable and novel.

â

â

Select VR experiences designed for relaxation and mindfulness. SomeVR applicationsoffer serene environments or guided meditation sessions that can help reduce stress and provide a mental break from exam-related worries.

â

Music has been proven to have various psychological and physiological effects, including its ability to positively impact mood, emotions, and stress levels. Research has shown that listening toclassical musicsuch as solo piano pieces, Mozart sonatas, calming compositions and similar gentle music can have positive effects on focus, concentration and mood.Â

So, put on a playlist of your favorite soothing music that uplifts your spirits!

â

Additionally, you can even explore brown noises.Brown noisesare basically deep rumbling sounds that resemble the low-frequency sounds of a waterfall or thunder. Studies have shown listening to specific noise types, including brown noise, might have potential benefits in reducing stress and promoting relaxation.

â

Refresh your stress-relief playlist regularly to keep it engaging and effective. Adding new tracks that resonate with your mood can enhance the playlist's impact, ensuring that it remains a helpful tool for managing stress.

â

Have you ever spent time with a cute puppy? Then you know that the fluffball can make all your problems disappear for a while! Spending time with animals can often reduce stress and have positive effects on mental well-being. Interacting with animals can trigger the release of oxytocin, often referred to as the "bonding hormone.â Oxytocin is associated with feelings like happiness, trust, and social bonding, which can ease stress and anxiety. Whether itâs spending time with your own pets or visiting an animal shelter, animals have a way of bringing joy and comfort.

â

Explore pet therapy sessions if you donât have your own pets. Many communities offer pet therapy programs where you can spend time with trained therapy animals. This experience can provide significant emotional relief and reduce stress.

â

Guided imagery involves using your imagination to create calming and soothing mental scenarios, such as imagining peaceful scenes, events, or objects. Engaging in guided imagery encourages your body's relaxation response by shifting your emotional state towards a more positive one.

â

â

Leverageguided imagery appsthat offer structured sessions and calming scenarios. These apps can guide you through relaxation exercises and help you develop a routine for managing stress effectively.

â

Engaging in puzzles and games can divert your attention away from the sources of stress. They provide a mental break and allow you to focus on something enjoyable and challenging, such as solving puzzles, tackling brain teasers, or playing strategy games. Switching your focus to a different type of mental challenge can break the cycle of exam-related stress.

â

Incorporate daily brain challenges into your routine to keep your mind sharp and engaged. Activities like Sudoku, crossword puzzles, or strategy games can provide a productive distraction and help alleviate stress.

â

â

For tutoring academies, using tools likeClasscardcan further enhance the learning experience. Classcard's comprehensive class management software allows for efficient scheduling, student tracking, and resource management, which can help in creating astructured and supportive learning environment. By streamlining administrative tasks, tutors can focus more on delivering high-quality education and personalized support to students. This can significantly reduce the stress associated with exam preparation, both for tutors and students.

â

Exams may be challenging, but by implementing these strategies, you can effectively reduce exam anxiety and improve your overall performance to a great extent. Remember that it's normal to experience some level of stress before exams, but with proper planning, self-care, and a positive mindset, you can tackle exams with confidence and success. Best of luck!

Test anxiety refers to the nervousness you might feel just before or during an exam.

Maybe your heart beats a little faster, or your palms start to sweat. Perhaps you feel overwhelmed by all the material you’ll need to remember. As the test approaches, you might even start to get a little nauseous.

If so, you’re not alone.Test anxietyis very common, and it can happen with any kind of exam, from an algebra final to a driving test.

However, research suggests some factors make test anxiety more likely:

A little anxiety is typical, and it can even help you focus on studying for the test. On the other hand,2019 researchon students in Malaysia suggests that severe anxiety could hurt your score in the end. After all, you might find it tough to give a test your full attention when the fear of failing dominates your thoughts.

Searching for strategies to overcome test anxiety? It’s not always possible to completely banish anxiety, but the tips below can help you do your best on any exam you’ve got coming.

One way to do your best on a test may come as no surprise: Know the material. If you’ve kept up with your classwork all semester, you’re less likely to feel panicked or stressed on the day of the test.

That’s because studying isn’t just about learning — it’s also about practice. For example, if you solve an algebra equation in your homework, you get experience solving that particular kind of problem.

When you face a similar question on your test, then, you might think back to your homework. This doesn’t just help refresh your memory, it also offers some proof you’re capable of answering the question. What’s more, familiar problems often feel less intimidating than completely new ones.

While studying can make plenty of difference in your score,quality restis important too.

A2018 studyinvolving high school seniors in Turkey considered sleep and test anxiety before university entrance exams. Students who felt they slept poorly the night before were more likely to have:

Of course, test anxiety can make it difficult to sleep before an exam. Asmall 2020 studyinvolving pharmacy students in the United States suggests students tend to get less sleep just before final exams.

Sleep deprivation, in turn, can have a negative impact on your exam performance.

To improve your chances ofgetting a good night’s sleep:

During exam season, you might find yourself increasing yourcaffeineconsumption through coffee, tea, soda, andenergy drinks.

Caffeine can boost your energy, absolutely. But it can also disrupt your sleep, according to a small 2013 study, especially if consumedwithin 6 hoursof your bedtime.

To put it another way, it may help to avoid consuming caffeine the night before the exam. If you want to use caffeine right before your test to make sure you’re alert, sticking to your regular amount is a good option.

A higher dose of caffeine may make you feel more alert than usual, but it can alsocause symptomslike:

According to a2020 studyinvolving medical students in Saudi Arabia, those who drank energy drinks before an exam reported higher levels of test anxiety. In fact, they reported higher levels of anxiety and distress than students who tookstimulant drugs.

Being late can make a stressful situation even more difficult. If your test is timed, you may feel extra pressure trying to answer all of the questions before the clock runs out.

Rushing to show up on time might only add to your stress. If you spend the 10 minutes before the exam scrambling to get to the right place, you’ll more than likely carry that anxiety (and the physical symptoms that come with it) right into the test with you.

Getting to the exam location early prevents those issues. Plus, it provides some time to transition from your everyday headspace to “exam mode.” A little breathing room can go a long way toward giving you a good start.

During the test, the answers to some questions will probably spring to mind right away. Other questions might seem like they came from a completely different class (one you didn’t take). Unless your test somehow prevents it, you might find it helpful to skip around and answer those easier questions first.

Every question you answer can boost your self-confidence and your conviction that you do know the material. You might not answer every question perfectly. But so long as you solve most of them, you can probably make out with a decent score.

When a question stumps you, you might want to give it a pass for the moment. You can always come back later if you have time at the end. If you stay stuck on one question too long, you might lose momentum and start doubting yourself again.

And who knows? Maybe you’ll get lucky and one of the later problems will offer a hint that helps you answer it.

When considering an exam as a whole, you might feel overwhelmed pretty quickly. You can make the test more manageable by breaking it up into chunks and tackling them piece by piece.

This strategy works for almost any kind of question:

When taking a test that could have an impact on your future, feelings of exam anxiety might quickly spiral out of control.

You may read a question you can’t answer and suddenly feel like the worst student ever. Your thoughts could jump to ever-worsening futures where you flunk the class, drop out of school, and never find it possible to succeed in anything again.

If these thoughts start racing in your head, you may want to put on the brakes. Consider the following:

Challenging your thoughtscan keep your worries from consuming you. Once you feel a little calmer, give the question a second pass.

If all else fails and your test is about to begin, try a few slow, deep breaths. Slowing down your breathing can help short-circuit yourfight-or-flight response. In other words, it can help reduce your heart rate, lower your blood pressure, and let your body know it’s time to chill out.

Diaphragmatic breathingcan be particularly helpful for easing anxiety, according to a2019 review. To try it:

Breathing may seem absurdly simple — after all, you do it practically every second. But it can be a surprisingly powerful tool tosoothe anxiety.

Anxiety before a test tells you something important: The outcome of the test matters to you. Still, that knowledge may not make much difference as you try to calm your pounding heart and keep your sweating palms dry enough to hold your pencil or grip the steering wheel.

Giving yourself plenty of time to study and getting a good night’s sleep before the test can help ease anxiety and prepare you to give your exam everything you’ve got.

If you consistently experience test anxiety, to the point where you find it difficult to complete tests even when you know the material, professional support could help. Atrained therapistcan offer more guidance with personalized coping techniques to work through test anxiety.

Exam time is not easy, so you won't be alone in feeling a bit overwhelmed by revision from time to time. But remember, you've got this – and these stress-busting tips can hugely help.

Ah, that old familiar knot in your stomach that tells you exams are looming. While some people like to believe a bit of anxiety and pressure can be beneficial around exam time, science suggests otherwise.

When we're stressed, our brains releasehigh levels of cortisolwhich can cloud the way we think and get in the way of rational thoughts. Because of this, it's important to stay as cool, calm and collected as you can during the exam period.

Yes, easier said than done.

Follow the practical steps below to relieve exam stress and the awful symptoms. The tips will alsoimprove your productivityand increase your chances of absolutely smashing it in your exams.

Here are the best ways to manage your stress levels and stay calm before and during your exams:

Prioritising your time, subjects and workload can make a big difference and help to reduce your anxiety levels. You'll be able to ensure that the really important stuff is covered – and at the right time.

Make a table with the dates of each exam and how many topics need to be covered for each. This will give you a clear idea of how much time you need to dedicate to each exam topic and when you need to start revising.

As you progress through your revision, tick off the topics that you've completed. This will give you a small sense of achievement, knowing that you're making progress.

This is pretty closely related to the tip above. But we can't emphasise enough how taking a bit of time to get yourself in order will help you reduce exam stress.

Tobecome more organised, it will help tomake a revision scheduleandwrite to-do listseach day. They'll make it easier to get everything done – and on time.

Working out adaily routineand sticking to it is also good for the soul. It will help you feel a lot more in control of how your day pans out.

Remember to factor inregular breaks. These will do you wonders. You could maybe try having a break for at least 10 minutes every hour and a half or so, if not more.

For more ideas, check out our guide to the topproductivity tips.

Sometimes theidea of exercisingduring times of high stress feels like the last thing you want to do. However,you'll feel better afterwards.

Exercise gets your blood flowing and your heart pumping. It's a proven stress-buster as it helps to produce endorphins. So, once you stop working out, you can feel a lot more alert than you had been earlier.

Give yourself that push to go for a run orvisit the gym. You could even just head out for a brisk walk if you fancy a lighter form of exercise.

Eating the right foods during stressful times is also absolutely crucial formental health and well-being. We have an entire list of the bestfoods to eat during exam time. Not only can these snacks reduce stress, but they can also increase brain power. Win-win.

Stepping away from social media while revising will do wonders for your stress levels.

Try to avoid checking apps like Instagram and TikTok while revising. We all know how quickly time disappears when you're swiping through your social feeds.

If you need a bit of help unchaining yourself from your phone, give theHold appa go. Hold gives you rewards (such asAmazon vouchers,cinema ticketsandfree coffee) for simply avoiding the use of your phone.

You get points every 20 minutes. This means you can break up your revision periods with some well-earned rests. They'll be well-needed, too. It's thought that revision is less effective if you study for any longer than about 90 minutes straight.

When it comes to dealing with exam stress, it's important to not give yourself such a hard time. We know this is easier said than done, but you're doing your best and that's the best you can do!

Keep your eye on the bigger picture, and remember that one "meh" result isn't the end of the world.

Putting yourself under a lot of pressure can have a negative effect. And as much of a cliché as this is,worrying really doesn't solve anything.

Being kind to yourself during periods of high anxiety is likely to give you a bit more motivation to work harder. Take some time out from revision topamper yourselfand catch up with your nearest and dearest.

If you fancy treating yourself (you deserve it!) have a look at ourstudent deals pageto see if there are any good discounts going so you can keep costs down.

We know, cutting out coffee during exam time seems like an impossible task. How are you going to stay awake long enough to memorise that 300-page textbook without your good friend caffeine to get you through? Or cigarettes to help you relax afterwards?

Well, caffeine is a stimulant and canincrease your stress levels, and the same applies to nicotine. Avoid drinking more than one cup of coffee a day and think aboutstopping smoking. And remember, fewer cigarettes meansmore savings!

If you can't cut them out completely, try to at least monitor your consumption. You could always try swapping coffee for herbal tea or water. This will keep your body hydrated and allow you tocope betterwith stress.

This might sound obvious, but try toavoid alcoholduring exam periods too.

Alcohol can act as a depressant when consumed in large quantities and as a stimulant when consumed in smaller quantities – neither of which is helpful. Ultimately, alcohol can make stress harder to deal with (find out more onDrinkaware's website).

So, instead of alcohol, you could try some cheap but tastynon-alcoholic drinksinstead.

Cutting out all of these substances will alsoimprove your sleepwhich, now more than ever, will help you massively.

One of the best ways to overcome exam stress ispractice– and plenty of it. That's because one of the most common reasons for feeling stressed ahead of exams is not being sure what to expect on the day.

Mock exams can help you prepare for what questions you're likely to be asked, and how best to approach answering them. Try to find examples of past exam questions to get an idea of what topics have previously come up.

Or, if there aren't any past exam questions available, consider whatessay/assignment titleshave been set by lecturers throughout the year. Have a think about other questions that are similar to these.

It's especially helpful to try tackling mock exam questions on topics you're less confident about. This way, you can prepare plans and practice answering them, in case they do come up in the exam.

By practising how to approach answers on a range of topics, including your most and least favourite ones, you'll put yourself in a great position. It will help you show exam markers how much you know and ace even the hardest exam questions.

It's common for students to worry about time management in exams. If you're concerned about running out of time and leaving questions unfinished, or rushing through questions and finishing the exam too early,practice, again, will help.

When practising mock exam questions, be strict with yourself over timings. Make sure you don't run over the amount of time you're allowed in the exam.

These practice exams will help youget more organised. While doing them, work out how long you should leave to plan answers, and how long you should spend on each section of your answer.

If, at first, you struggle to finish your answers on time or you have too much time left over at the end, keep practising until youperfect the timings.

It's worth asking your lecturer to take a look through your practice answers. This would really help to identify any areas you could improve on. Some teachers will be more willing to do this than others, but if you never ask, you'll never know.

With all this practice, by the time you reach your exam, you'll be a pro with timings and have a great idea of what kinds of questions to expect on the day.

Now you know how to deal with exam stress, it's time to get back into study mode. And just in case you didn't believe us before, we hope you do now that you really have got this!

Left your revision to the last minute? We've got you covered with our guide torevising in a day.

How do I deal with workplace anxiety?


Why You Should Talk About Your Anxiety at Work | Adam Whybrew | TED - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FT5RYuifwE

Transcript:
(00:05) so I lead teams of data scientists and we solve business problems using difficult analytics and when I start working with someone new I ask them how I will know if they're struggling and I don't mean struggling with a business problem or with a difficult analytics they don't struggle with that I mean struggling with their Mental Health and to make them feel comfortable to tell me because I want them to tell me I tell them how they will know if I'm struggling so I might be just unrealistically calm or they
(00:44) might get any kind of message from me at all before 900 in the morning cuz I'm not a morning person message before 9: very bad sign now I do this because I have suffered from anxiety and depression and it was horrible and if there was a magic button I could press that would rid the world of those two things I'd press it straight away but if that button only worked for me if all it meant is that I wouldn't have got to pressed I'd leave it alone and that's because of some things that happened in the weeks and months as
(01:24) I was recovering from depression but also things that happened years later when I started talking about it at work and it improved my relationships with colleagues so let's step back in time it's 2012 it's a Friday morning in May and the sun is out in London and I'm walking to work along the banks of the temps and all around there are British flags flying and there's this quiet excitement in the city and that's cuz the Olympics were coming there in two months time and that morning like every other
(02:00) morning at the time I'd woken up about 3 hours earlier than normal thinking and worrying about work and I'd got up just wretching with anxiety and gone to the bathroom and been sick and I felt a bit better after that make my way to work but by the time I got to work I could barely speak so I could just about order a cup of coffee but apart from that for the mornings I was pretty much silent and coffee was about the extent of my diet so I'd pretty much given up eating and that's probably not what you would
(02:38) have expected if you'd been walking past me on that Sunny Friday morning with the flags flying and the Olympics coming and after a couple of weeks things hadn't got any better and so I decided I shouldn't go to work so I founded the team and told them and a few days later I got professional help and what a difference that made so my psychologist gave me really simple practical advice things like you really need to eat because feeling anxious and feeling hungry are very similar feelings in your body another bit of advice was don't get
(03:19) up and go to the bathroom and be sick get up go to the kitchen make a cup of tea read a book so I did that helped a bit with the morning vomiting I had to learn how to switch off from work now anyone can stop working that's easy the difficult thing is stopping thinking about work and to do that I would imagine a green force field around the house that would keep thoughts of work out and I still switch that force field on from time to time it helps me put off until tomorrow things that I could do today if
(03:57) I do them tomorrow they'll be a bit rushed they will be less good but are we good enough and my wife who saw this change in my working patterns was convinced I was going to get fired I actually been promoted twice since then now I also had to learn how to enjoy spending time with my wife and with my family and friends and it sounds easy but it really wasn't at first so I remember going out for pizza with the family and all I wanted to do was lie on the floor curl up into a bow and grown now fortunately for
(04:32) everyone in the pizza restaurant I didn't do that uh but it was still really awkward cuz all I could think of to talk about was how miserable I was anyway with a bit of practice it got less awkward I got a bit less self-absorbed and I learned to enjoy other people again and one day about a few weeks after I first got professional help I woke up in the morning feeling fine just feeling normal and I have done every day since then now some people can do a really good job at work when they're anxious or depressed and I am not one of those
(05:12) people so I really did a terrible job the team had to carry me it's really very difficult to contribute if you can't speak all morning as first time I'd ever really failed at anything and I can't tell you how comforting it is now to know that I can fail at something even something quite important Life Will Go On and I'll be fine and because I'd done such a terrible job at work I didn't want anyone to know about it it was this kind of shameful secret so the the strange thing is what happened when I did start
(05:50) talking about it at work and it started very privately so if I was working with someone and it seemed like they were struggling I'd tell them some of my story it seemed to help a bit it wasn't as awkward and horrible as I thought it might be so I got a bit braver and I said to our HR team if you come across someone who's struggling with their mental health I'll be happy to talk to them oneon-one if you think it would help and I did that a few times and I still do and what that meant was when the HR team were putting
(06:24) together a booklet about what to do if you're struggling with your mental health they asked me and some other people to share our stories anonymously and I did that but when I sent the message I asked them to print my name next to it now have you ever sent a message and thought Oh I wonder if that was a good idea so that was what I felt and I was quite scared it was going to hundreds of people there was no going back it was in writing and I was worried people would think it would happen again and they wouldn't want to work with me I was
(06:58) worried they'd think was weak and self-indulgent and maybe some people do and I was worried that even if they didn't think either of those things it would just be on their Minds when they were talking to me later on that's not what happened what actually happened was people got in touch to say it was really comforting to have someone quite senen you say I had this experience it was horrible I got through it I'm still here and I'm doing fine and gradually I started talking about it to larger and larger audiences
(07:31) so there's a podcast about it uh we did a session for people who were struggling during lockdown and if you're not sick of hearing about me being sick in the mornings you can read about it on two websites and one day about 10 years after that sunny day in London I stood up in front of 600 of my colleagues and told them the full story and after that people from all levels of the company right up to the the very top took me aside and shared that they had either been through something like that or they were going
(08:06) through something like that at the time and then I'd say the most common emotion that I picked up from them was relief that they were just relieve that someone was talking about it openly one person actually took me aside on the stairs more than a year later to say it had given him the push he needed and wanted to go and get some help for some things he was struggling with at the time now one of the people in that audience of 600 was new to the company and she said to me hearing that talk made me feel like this was my kind of
(08:42) place and I think she actually got to the bottom of what it made me feel like so if I could stand up in front of all my colleagues and tell them this story that had been terribly embarrassing and upsetting and shameful felt shameful at the time and it was fine well it made it feel like my kind of place too and we know from Amy edmonson's work on psychological safety that that feeling improves the performance of teams now I didn't stand up and tell 600 people about vomiting in the morning to improve their performance but if it does
(09:19) I'll take it that's great it is possible to go too far with this and I know that because I did so I got some great Anonymous feedback that said Adam is always talking to me to make sure I'm not depressed or anxious he never talks to me about work or my career so after that I changed a bit what I talked to people about now I'm not saying that if you've suffered from mental illness you should tell everyone at work all about it if you're experiencing it now you probably won't regret telling someone
(09:56) you trust if you've recovered you may find like me that telling people about it goes better than you expect there's no guarantees and there's still plenty of prejudice around nor am I saying that if you are suffering from anxiety or depression you should be really thankful because of all these terrific benefits you're going to get that I got and it's good for your character I'm not saying that at all it's really horrible I feel for you if you are lucky enough to be able to get professional
(10:30) help please do I cannot tell you how much a how much of a difference that has made to my life if you can't get professional help look for free resources online and in either case remember that you're not the first person to have gone through something like this that depression and anxiety are treatable and that you are not alone now on that Sunny Friday morning in London I had no idea that within a few months I would have recovered to something better than I was before I started to get anxious and when I felt really worried
(11:15) sending the message to the HR team about printing my name next to my story I had no idea what would follow from that and how beneficial it would be for me and for other people there's no guarantee sees that anyone else will experience the same thing and that's why if there was this magic button for ridding the world of anxiety and depression I'd press it straight away but unfortunately that button is still an imaginary button it's not real and while it stays like that I think we would all do better by talking about it
(11:51) thank you [Applause]

(01:44) and physical industry in injury 30% more and yet we we struggle in which we struggle on CI review workplaces and how they support people or not on mental health and I've interviewed more than 170 people and looked at the information from 15,000 survey respondents and a mental health is complex but this much I know people who have poor mental health they want to be at work on the whole and they struggle in to do that when they're at work they they have difficulty concentrating communicating juggling tasks and they get cranky sometimes with
(02:34) the customers and colleagues but they can't speak up to their manager the manager doesn't know how to have a conversation the employee doesn't know if the manager is going to support them or stigmatize them or say well we're all stress mate or manage them out of the organization so our employee who wants to be at work doesn't know the support choices can't have a conversation about it they feel significant stigma sometimes from the organization sometimes from themselves and it just rumbles on right they they don't take
(03:08) the time off that they need or if they do they give a different reason for their absence and here's one of the reasons was because we just don't talk enough about mental health in our workplaces until past breaking point how do we get to this well I thought we were all supposed to be resilient these days in the workplace we are supposed to have brazilians how do you get resilience well you ought to have a good work-life balance that's the first thing okay life life life the field of flowers that I
(03:44) skip through to and from work right if your life's like anything like my life it contains things like separation and grief and dental bills and add peas that get stuck up your child's nostril and exhaust that fall off your car the day after the MOT but we we soldier on my rucksack now three-quarters full we were taught to and we go into work and when we shouldn't really be there presenteeism it's called and presenteeism costs the workplace 1.

(04:52) the first NHS response okay it's well-meaning and I get that and sometimes time time off from from work is a really good thing and seeing our doctor is a good thing but it's not the first place for that conversation it took an employment lawyer in King's Lynn in Norfolk 28 seconds to be signed off from work having entered the consultation room it's not the first place for that so you leave the surgery with a with a label a diagnosis and you're staring down a packet of pills and daytime television and it's it's
(05:32) really scary I've been there and and if we just so quick to disengage people we need to be having these conversations in the workplace rather than disengaging and let me tell you about disengaging and I know illustrate the business case for this so I I interviewed somebody called Nick was a senior manager global firm constantly exceeding expectations at appraisal because there are appraisals remember to get more money we have to do more work than we should be doing different point but anyway so Nick Nick's mom died then
(06:11) he had his two or three days compassionate leave and he came back to the organization and he tried to organize himself some flexi time work more during the week have a bit of more time off from fridays and his manager said no on the basis that and I quote everyone will want it Nick's a good lovely guy a really lovely guy and really did it him but of course you know he was unable to talk to his manager they fell out he went to the doctor he got lots more time off but this was sickness and he disengaged and he never
(06:45) really came back to the organization properly unions go involved cost a lot of money and was entirely avoidable Sally's story Sally is or sell his dad died as she was working for international charity again you get successful manager and her manager said Sally I don't think you're right I think you need some more time off I think you you know we can do some work from home and a phased return and you might be surprised here that Sally still works for that organization it's still a high flier okay and she's an advocate of the
(07:28) employer so had they had the global firm that Nick worked for acted like the charity it would have saved itself many thousands of pounds okay so what should we do leaders had teachers project managers whoever wherever you lead you need to talk about mental health in the workplace when you speak other people listen okay the the conversation the positive language it cascades down an organization you don't make more people unwell by speaking about mental health you give them the opportunity to seek help sooner remember
(08:08) Nick remember Sally leaders who talk about mental health universally gain respect same with managers managers you need to talk about mental health in the workplace and you need to train managers train and train them to spot the signs and the symptoms know what to say know when to say it know where to shut up know when to listen know how to have a human conversation if you're a manager use this rule of thumb be the manager you'd like to have if you were experiencing stress anxiety depression HR an occupational health I can I can
(08:46) pretty much guarantee that your schools and and your workplaces policies on stress anxiety depression or absence and and those sorts of things are probably too long full of jargon self-serving same with the the the absence procedure right they when somebody calls in sick on that first day as a golden conversation for a dialogue on mental health who's listening who's writing this down where is it going who's offering support and this is the same thing for your people right you've got it you've got it
(09:19) offer support to your people therapy is fantastic stuff but through the NHS it's gonna take you eight weeks three months six lessons of therapy three hundred pounds what's that compared to a great bit of time off in it and that disengaging it's off your therapy the other thing we do with people when they join in a workplace is we teach them how to lift a box which is great and thank you for that but why don't we talk to them about how to have a conversation with a colleague okay call it when they're struggling
(09:50) okay so if you were out there and you see somebody struggling then say something say how are you my cup of tea if you think you're struggling that you should say something this is not just a a a once and done conversation it's all just a poster on the back of the toilet door it's a camp it's a cultural shift and it takes time okay but the wonderful thing is that everybody can do this okay what you need is a tray of sandwiches and a packet of post-it notes and a bunch of people who've been off while
(10:25) they've been working for you okay they'll give you all the information that you need okay you could you could partner with a charity like mindful employer if you like you could hire a consultant if you must but you really ought to be listening making adjustments changes and writing this down the Health and Safety Executive expect you to be doing this already by the way right in the future would be we'll be talking about some of the things that have been mentioned today mindfulness meditation in meetings virtual reality glasses to
(11:01) Train managers reporting on on workplace illness as well as injury little robots that pop up on your screen to ask you how you are psychotherapy through our mobile phone those things are being trialed right now they're just around the corner but here's the thing you're people don't need to throw loads of money of this what they want from you is your commitment that they can speak safely about mental health I said you all you all have the resources to do this look around you this is what mental
(11:36) health is it's not just the one in 103 we all have mental health all the time the hands up who'd like their employer to do more on mental health right as an employer all you need to do is give your people permission to speak safely and be prepared to listen thank you [Applause] [Music] you

Work anxiety is anxiety that’s caused by work. Different work situations, from overlapping deadlines to unstable economic conditions, can create work anxiety. If you’re struggling with work-related stress, you’re not alone—and there’s hope. Learn how to take control of your work anxiety, and get your work life back on track.

Think about the last time someone at work—maybe a colleague or your manager—asked you how you were doing. How did you respond? If you’re like a lot of us, you probably said something like, “I’m good, how are you?”—even if it wasn’t true.

The truth might have sounded something more like this: I’m losing sleep over a big presentation. I struggle to stop thinking about work when I’m at home. I’m burned out, and I don’t know who to talk to for help. The state of the world feels scary, and I’m worried about my job security.

It can be hard to acknowledge the fear and anxiety we feel about work, especially in times of change or uncertainty. Often, our workplaces feel like the last environment where we can show up as our whole selves, fears and all. But if you struggle with work-related stress or work anxiety, you’re not alone; according to a 2021 study fromMental Health America, 83% of workers feel emotionally drained from their work, and 85% agreed that workplace stress affects their mental health.

These feelings are valid, and acknowledging them matters. But your work worries don’t have to control you or interfere with your life outside of work. The first step in combating your work anxiety is learning more about what might be causing it. From there, you can learn how to address it and keep it from dominating your life.

Work anxiety, also known as work stress, is anxiety that’s caused by and revolves around work. The experience of work anxiety and what causes it is different for everyone. For some, impending deadlines or an upcoming presentation are enough to cause work anxiety. For others, social situations at work, such as a poor work culture or a lack of connection with coworkers, might cause work anxiety. Larger issues, such as concerns about job security,organizational change, or macroeconomic conditions, can also cause a flare in work anxiety.

No matter the cause, work anxiety always revolves around work and the workplace. This type of anxiety can have short-term and long-term consequences, such as reduced productivity,missed deadlines, career stagnation, and even job loss. Prolonged work stress can be even more far-reaching, leading toburnoutand more.

That all sounds pretty scary—and it can be. But work anxiety is also manageable with the right tools. The first step is acknowledging your anxiety so you can move through it.

Anxiety is a common feeling. According to theNational Institute of Mental Health, 40 million U.S. adults struggle with an anxiety disorder. If you’re feeling anxious at work, it can be hard to know if you’re experiencing generalized anxiety or work anxiety.

While anxiety at work and work anxiety might sound (and even feel) similar, they aren’t the same. The major difference is the cause—any number of outside factors can cause generalized anxiety, whereas work specifically causes work anxiety. Other tell-tale signs of work anxiety include:

Your anxiety is focused around—and limited to—work and the workplace and doesn’t extend to other parts of your life

Your anxiety lessens when you’re not at work and during your days off

Your anxiety developed in response to something that happened or is happening in the workplace

You struggle with social or physical symptoms of anxiety, but only at work or when thinking about work

It’s difficult to overcome something you don’t know you have. If you’ve felt on edge in the workplace lately or are struggling with physical or psychological symptoms connected to your work, you might be experiencing work anxiety.

We’ve rounded up the common symptoms of work anxiety. Take a look and see if any feel familiar. Once you’ve named what you’re experiencing, you’ll be on the path to finding a solution.

Feeling irritable or frustrated when at work (or when thinking about work)

Struggling to start working andprocrastinatingon assignments or deadlines

Feelingoverwhelmedor physically sick at the thought of checking work notifications

Missing deadlines or turning in substandard work without an outside cause

Experiencing difficulty concentrating or feeling disconnected from your work

Worrying excessively about upcoming work to the point that worry interferes with your personal life

Feeling dread at the thought of going to work and/or consistently experiencing theSunday scaries

Experiencing physical symptoms, such as trouble sleeping, fatigue, and uneasiness, as a direct result of work stress

Overreacting to feedback or other stressful work situations

Focusing intently on the negative aspects of your work or workplace

The causes of work anxiety are wide-ranging and vary from person to person. Sometimes internal factors, likeimposter syndromeor self-imposed pressure, can cause work anxiety. Other times, external factors likeworkplace conflicts, a heavy workload, or market trends can be the source.

Finding theroot causeof your work anxiety can help you overcome it. Common situations that might lead to work anxiety include:

Unclear goals or expectations

External factors like fearing for your job security

Lack of support and transparency from your manager

A poor work-life balance, resulting inoverworkand long hours

Workplace conflicts, such as bullying or harassment

Disconnection or isolation from coworkers

Struggling with general anxiety or a social anxiety disorder, which can make you more susceptible to workplace anxiety

Mountingworkplace burnout

Unfulfillment in your role or feeling overlooked

Unrealistic deadlines or an unmanageable workload

Upcoming projects or work commitments you feel unprepared for

Lacking a sense of purpose at work

Work anxiety can be short-term and long-term. Short-term work anxiety is often caused by situational factors, such as an upcoming presentation. Long-term work anxiety is more likely to be caused by large factors, such as organization change or macroeconomic conditions.

No matter the cause, work anxiety can have wide-ranging effects that impact your life, both in and out of the workplace. If you struggle with work anxiety, you may feel less confident in your role, preventing you from taking on additional responsibilities or volunteering for growth opportunities. Work anxiety can also become a self-fulfilling prophecy, where you worry so much about missing deadlines you become unable to function at work, leading to missed deadlines.

Other consequences of work anxiety include:

Reduced job performance

Isolation from coworkers

Loss of productivity

Lowered confidence and the development ofimposter syndrome

Career stagnation

Reduced job satisfaction

Missed deadlines

Hampered career development

Impacted personal life and well-being

Turning down promotions due to work phobias, such as public speaking

We all have work worries: from unread emails that keep us from focusing on our family dinners to the upcoming deadlines that pull our focus away from a night out with friends. When these work worries become too difficult to ignore, they can blossom into full-on work anxiety.

If you’re struggling with work anxiety, the first thing to remember is that your anxiety is real—and part of dealing with it is simply acknowledging its existence and finding ways to cope with, and eventually overcome, what you’re feeling.

It’s not always easy to admit when you’re struggling. Often, we push aside our feelings or allow ourselves to invalidate them. We tell ourselves we’re doing what we need to push through or that it’s not that bad. These negative self statements might even feel necessary at work, where performance is important. In fact,40% of workersthink burnout is an inevitable part of success—an idea that could lead to pushing ourselves too hard at work.

Instead of tamping down your feelings of anxiety, acknowledge what you’re experiencing as valid. Recognize that your anxious work thoughts are normal, and embrace them for what they are: thoughts. Then, you can begin to move toward a solution.

Feelingoverwhelmed at workis a common cause of work anxiety. And in our always-on work culture, it’s no surprise—according to the2022 Anatomy of Work Index, burnout and imposter syndrome are “key challenges” facing knowledge workers, with 42% suffering both at the same time. Workers are also dealing with the negative effects of technology; over a third feel overwhelmed by persistent pings and notifications.

The takeaway? Workers feel exhausted by the amount of work they’re assigned and insecure about their performance at work. But it doesn’t have to be that way. By speaking with your manager when you feel overwhelmed and learning how toprioritize your tasksto effectively manage your time, you can make sure you’re focusing on your most important work and delegating—or eliminating—non-essential work.

There are so manytime management techniquesyou can use to keep yourself on track and help calm your work anxiety—a few of our favorites include:

Using theEisenhower Matrixto prioritize your tasks

Grouping similar tasks and saving small tasks for in between meetings

Usingtime blockingto schedule a more productive day

Tackling big tasks in the morning with the “eat the frog” time management strategy

Using thePomodoro Techniqueto break work into manageable chunks

Similar to feeling overwhelmed, feeling (or being) disorganized can take a toll on your ability to perform at work. Unorganized workers can be more likely to miss deadlines or overlook important tasks, leading to stress and anxiety. What’s more, visual clutter can actually distract you—so in addition to an organized to-do list, keeping your workspace clean and organized is important too.

There are a lot of ways you canget organizedat work and reduce work anxiety, including:

Declutter andorganize your desk setup

Create ato-do liststructure that actually works

Use theGetting Things Done (GTD) methodto keep track of your tasks

Remove distractions and learn how tostay focused

Create aweekly work planand adaily scheduleto map your work

Often, work anxiety happens because you feel pressure to perform, but don’t know exactly what you need to get done (or when it’s due). Aproject management toolcan help. By visualizing all of your tasks, deadlines, and next steps in one place, you can see that your workload is doable. Or, if it isn’t, you can re-prioritize and reschedule work as needed.

Our modern work culture blurred the lines between work and home, and theshift to remote workcaused by the COVID pandemic further loosened the boundaries between our home lives and work lives. In fact, according to the2022 Anatomy of Work Index, 37% of workers said their days don’t have a clear start or finish time. More than a third of workers also said they spend more time checking emails and thinking about work outside of working hours compared to last year. The result: workers struggle to draw hard lines between when they’re on the clock and off of it, leading to overwork and a poor work-life balance.

Setting—and sticking to—clear boundaries is essential to creating a work-free space during off-hours, which can help reduce work anxiety. Setting clear boundaries might look like this:

Learning to say “no” to asks when you’re at capacity

Taking time off to disconnect and recharge

Communicating to your manager or your team when you’re feeling overwhelmed

Setting specific “on” and “off” hours and adhering to them

Snoozing notifications when you’re offline

Removing work applications from your phone or personal devices and only checking emails during work hours

Sometimes, practicing good time management strategies and implementing organizational techniques is enough to help you get back on track and reduce work anxiety. Other times, you’ll need to take additional steps, like bringing up your workload with your manager.

Signs you might need to take another look at your workload include feeling overwhelmed by multiple deadlines or uncertain about what work to prioritize. In this case, it’s important to have a candid conversation with your manager about potentially lightening your load.

Speaking to your manager about a heavy workload can be intimidating, especially when workplaces are trying to do more with less—it’s natural to worry that the conversation could reflect poorly on you or your work abilities. When you approach your manager, frame your conversation around the stress you’re feeling and your desire to find a solution.Effectively communicatingyour concerns by clearly stating where you’re struggling and offering solutions will help build empathy and a shared understanding that you’re not looking to do less work.

Once you’ve discussed your workload concerns with your manager, work together to set realistic and achievable deadlines. Review previously set goals and due dates and adjust where possible.

A few ways to set realistic goals and deadlines with the help of your manager include:

Make sure you’re settingSMART goals

Use apriority matrixto identify your most important work

Delegate workthat’s not important or that someone else can do

Understand goals and responsibilities when working onmultiple projects

Setshort-term goalsto break down your larger objectives into digestible tasks

A mental health day is exactly what it sounds like—a day to focus on your mental health. Just like you’d take a sick day if you were feeling under the weather, mental health days are helpful if you’re struggling with burnout or work anxiety symptoms.

While some companies have built-in days for workers to use as mental health days, others encourage employees to use singular PTO or sick days for the purpose, so be sure to check your company’s policy before you take one. Then, spend your day relaxing and recharging, whatever that means for you. And remember: If you continue to feel distraught after your mental health day or dread the idea of returning to work, it might be an indication of deepening burnout or another mental health concern.

While work anxiety and general anxiety are different, they often have similar symptoms, so practicing anti-anxiety techniques can often help calm your feelings of stress in the short term. These tactics aren’t a cure for work anxiety, but they can provide much-needed relief when you feel overwhelmed.

Coping techniques that can help you combat a work anxiety attack include:

Practice deep breathing exercises

Go for a long walk

Repeat a calming mantra

Step away from your computer or work and take a break

Recognize, acknowledge, and validate your anxious thoughts

If you’re still struggling with work anxiety after talking to your manager, adjusting your workload, and getting organized, check to see if your company has any additional resources that might be able to help. Reach out to the benefits or HR team to see if there are any subsidies for professional help, like coaching, therapy, employee assistance programs, orprofessional developmentcourses that could be of assistance.

For some, feeling stagnant at work causes work anxiety, so settingprofessional goalsor taking advantage of development benefits likesabbatical leavecan reinvigorate your career passion and keep you from feeling disconnected. For others,finding a mentoror taking advantage of wellness programs can help. See what your company has to offer.

If you’ve tried our tips and still find yourself struggling with work anxiety (or find that your work anxiety is increasing), it might be time to ask for additional help. Unchecked, work anxiety can develop into more severe mental health concerns, such as generalized anxiety disorder or depression.

Signs that your work anxiety might be evolving into a more serious health concern include:

Your anxiety begins to impact your life and relationships outside of work

Your coping mechanisms no longer provide relief from your anxiety

You feel you need to take more time off than usual but don’t feel refreshed or re-motivated when returning to work

Your work anxiety impacts your physical health

You become unable to perform at work, including consistently missing deadlines or failing to complete tasks

If these symptoms sound familiar, talk to your manager, mentor, or human resources department about next steps.

Dealing with work anxiety can be difficult, but it’s not insurmountable. With the right tools and techniques, you’re on your way to facing—and, eventually, overcoming—your work worries for good.

Do anxious feelings tend to bubble up suddenly while you’re at work? Do you get nervous just thinking about your job? Does your mood change come Monday morning, orSunday evening, for that matter?

If your anxiety revolves around work, you might be experiencing workplace anxiety, also known as workstress. And you’re most certainly not alone.

According to Mental Health America’s2021 Mind the Workplace report, almost 83 percent of respondents felt emotionally drained from their work. And 85 percent — or nearly 9 in 10 workers — reported that job stress affected their mental health.

Of course, you don’t need to go into an office or job site to experience workplace anxiety. You can experience these feelings when working from home, too. (Zoom anxiety, anyone?)

But the situation is far from hopeless. Here’s everything you need to know about workplace anxiety, along with practical strategies for reducing and managing work stress.

First, it’s not always easy to tell whether you’re experiencing workplace anxiety or symptoms of an anxiety disorder.

The tell-tale sign? Your anxiety is limited to work.

Annia Palacios, a licensed professional counselor (LPC) withTightrope Therapy, offers a few key signs of workplace anxiety:

How do you know when your symptoms might relate togeneralized anxiety disorderor another anxiety condition?

Anxiety disorder symptoms are “persistent, consistent, and negatively affect several aspects of your life,” says Emme Smith, a licensed psychotherapist and CEO ofGraySpace Counseling Group.

The key difference between the two, explainsAlexandra Finkel, LCSW, a licensed psychotherapist and co-founder of Kind Minds Therapy, is that workplace anxiety generally developsin responseto stress at work. An anxiety disorder, on the other hand, tends to develop, and persist, regardless of your work circumstances.

Learn more about the signs and symptoms of anxiety disorders.

Workplace anxiety can involve a wide range of symptoms.

According to Palacios, you might:

You might also experience a sense of dread when you think about going to work and feel overwhelmed once you get there, saysBoone Christianson, a licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT) and author of the book “101 Therapy Talks.”

Workplace anxiety can involvephysical symptoms, too. These might include:

A number of factors can contribute to workplace anxiety, and these can vary from person to person.

For example, says Palacios, work stress may stem from:

According toKimberly Wilson, PhD, LMFT, an organizational psychologist and therapist, you could also develop workplace anxiety if your job:

In some cases, your work stress can also have a deeper, more subtle underlying cause or contributing factor.

For example, says Christianson, maybe you’ve had negative experiences in the past with making phone calls, or your boss reminds you of your dad. Maybe your college professor’s harsh criticism sharpened your sensitivity to any kind of feedback on writing-related tasks.

As Palacios also points out, “being an anxious person or having a pre-existing anxiety disorder can make us more likely to experience workplace-specific anxiety.”

For example, she notes, if you already live with anxiety you might go straight to the worst-case scenario. Consequently, your workplace might become a significant source of stress if you (mistakenly) assume:

Workplace anxiety can feel overwhelming and unrelenting. But with a few small steps, you can successfully overcome or manage your work stress.

The triggers of work stress aren’t always obvious. “Writing out moments when you feel nervous throughout the day will help you find patterns or triggers,” says Smith.

Maybe you regularly feel nervous and nauseous before weekly team meetings, or you have trouble concentrating on anything after you encounter one specific co-worker.

Identifying specific situations that increase your stress levels can help you figure out the best strategy to handle them going forward.

“Worry in the form of ‘what-ifs’ is a common type of workplace anxiety,” saysMax Maisel, PhD, a licensed clinical psychologist in Los Angeles who specializes in anxiety disorders and OCD.

To better understand what’s going on and explore possible solutions, you can try asking yourself questions about those “what-ifs” until you’ve uncovered your core fear. Maisel suggests “Why is that a bad thing?” and “What does this mean about me?” as good questions to start with.

How do you know you’ve found your core fear?

Typically, it’s “when you can no longer ask ‘Why is this a bad thing?’ or you feel a gut sense that you hit on something viscerally important,” says Maisel.

When you’ve reached that place, he suggests acknowledging the story without assuming it’s true and then thanking your mind for trying to protect you.

From there, you can gently challenge the fear by asking yourself:

When you get anxious and stress levels soar, your natural inclination might be to respond with self-criticism.

Instead, try to be patient and understanding with your reactions.

How? You can start by labeling and leaning into your feelings. You might simply say, “I’m feeling frazzled right now, and that’s okay.”

Similarly, you can also think about treating yourself like you’d treat a close friend or family member, says Maisel.

You might say something like, “It’s OK to feel overwhelmed. You’re doing a lot. But you’re doing the best you can.”

You can recalibrate your emotions by taking small, short breaks throughout the day, according to Palacios. For instance, she suggests:

When anxiety pulls your mind elsewhere, you can also try the 54321 technique to ground yourself in the present moment, says Finkel.

To practice, she says, simply name:

During and after exercise, the body releases calming neurotransmitters that create an overall feeling of well-being, says Karlene Kerfoot, chief nursing officer atsymplr.

“Exercising before work can help your body cope with workplace situations that may cause anxiety, and exercise after work can help place you in a different mindset where you can better cope with such feelings,” she says.

When big projects and presentations produce anxiety, getting organized can help reduce feelings of overwhelm, says Finkel.

She suggests:

In other words, try to use your anxiety to propel you to accomplish tasks instead of putting them off.

Could some boundaries help keep your work-related stressor in check?

If your stress relateswork-life balanceor work relationships, Finkel suggests:

Finding something to laugh about can release tension, shift your perspective, and stimulate positive neurotransmitters, says Kerfoot. Humor can even help you take yourself, not to mention your workplace, less seriously.

To give yourself a good laugh:

If you have a workspace, you can create a mini sanctuary or retreat that offers solace during stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, says Smith.

For example, she says, you might:

If you don’t have a designated workspace, you can assemble a kit that provides a “quick shot of relief during stressful moments at work,” says Wilson.

Your kit can include items that soothe your senses and help you move.

Wilson offers a few examples:

Strive to create a life filled with relationships, events, and activities outside of work that bring you joy, peace, and happiness, Kerfoot recommends. She goes on to explain that a fulfilling life outside of work can:

To get started, consider the people, places, and pastimes that bring you joy and calm. How can you add them to your days?

If you’re dealing with workplace anxiety, professional support can be incredibly helpful.

How do you know when help from a therapist might have benefit?

There’s no right or wrong time to connect with a therapist, Palacios says, so this decision will be unique to everyone.

In general, however, she recommends seeking professional help when you want your life to be differentbutyou haven’t found it possible to make changes on your own.

Specifically, Palacios says, this could mean you:

A therapist can offer support with:

Workplace anxiety is common, but it’s very manageable. Small steps, like understanding your triggers, setting boundaries, and taking restorative breaks, can go a long way.

That said, if your work stress becomes difficult to cope with alone, don’t hesitate to seek professional support. A therapist can always offer compassionate guidance with identifying possible causes and exploring your options for addressing them.

Above all, remember: You deserve to work in a safe, reasonable environment.

Transcript:
(00:03) [Music] when I was in high school about to graduate early with high honors instead of picking out a prom dress or preparing for college I was preparing for the end I was at one of the lowest deepest and darkest points in my life and I was ready to give up I was so ashamed of the person that I was becoming and for the mistakes that I was making that I couldn't even look myself in the mirror anymore I remember it was one night I was sitting in my car on the edge of the lake in my hometown and through the uncontrollable sobbing tears and the
(01:03) music that I had blasted well feeling so ashamed after another one-night stand and another hit of dope that I wanted it to end it was either the drugs were going to take me or I was going to end it all myself I was so ashamed I was 17 years old and I was struggling with an opioid use disorder for those of you who don't know what opioids are I encourage you to please become educated because heroin and prescription pills are destroying our communities in fact one out of three households today in America are being affected by the addiction
(01:55) crisis and mine was one of them but it all started with a secret a secret that I held on to for so long that eventually it made me sick but this secret wasn't about my addiction no using for me was just a way to cope and mask the pain my secret was so much deeper than that my secret was that I never felt good enough when I was five years old my parents got divorced and in a world where I should have been playing with dolls and watching cartoons I was blaming myself for their divorce was I not being a good enough daughter for
(02:51) them to stay together I grew up watching my parents struggle with their own addictions along with other family members I even grew up having four older sisters and as you can imagine I felt like I saw more and knew way more than I should have at such a young age by the time I got to middle school the thoughts and worries around being good enough were all around me it was almost as if I was wearing a mask because feeling good enough I started to place my own self-worth and value on things that really didn't matter
(03:36) things like what I looked like what type of clothes I was wearing what kind of house we lived in and what kind of cars we drove I started wearing makeup at too young of an age and I started to worry about what others thought of me especially boys but I would go to school every day and I would put a fake smile on my face wearing a mask pretending to be somebody that I wasn't because I just wanted to fit in I thought that if I could just be like everyone else then I wouldn't feel so alone when in fact I
(04:18) started to feel lonelier than I did before what was it that I was searching for I mean I had great parents they still loved me and took care of me as any parent would be they were still on my back about cleaning my room doing the dishes responding to their text messages which they still expect to this day I had great friends I played sports we had sleepovers and I even got good grades but still I felt like something was missing I wanted to feel like there was greater meaning and purpose to my life or as why I was even put here on this earth I was
(05:06) searching for a deeper meaning is this life I am living enough if so then why am I still not enough that's why I started experimenting with drugs and alcohol at the age of 14 I thought I found the perfect mask that would temporarily make me feel like I was good enough as I continued to use the thoughts around being good enough and the questions even around my existence started to vanish I became addicted you see I remember hearing the phrase just say no but it wasn't just that easy once I found the perfect mass to hide behind
(06:01) I continued to bury my pain and my secrets even deeper that's when I began to fall prey to the question why me why is this happening to me something I'm sure maybe all of us have asked ourselves at some point or maybe we have had this feeling of not feeling good enough maybe for you it was you didn't feel smart enough or pretty enough or skinny enough or strong enough or just enough in anything that you do and the secret to being enough was just always out of reach fast forward a few years for me and going into high school
(06:53) and all of my dreams goals and aspirations that I had as a child started to slowly disappear I didn't know where to turn or who to talk to you as I continued to use this feeling of not feeling good enough became worse and I couldn't look at myself in the mirror anymore as I continued to use I continued to make horrible decisions I started getting into trouble with the law and instead of asking for help I ended up using even more heavily going back to that night at the lake yes I drove away by God's grace yes I am still
(07:53) here but like I said instead of asking for help I started using even more and as things became worse I eventually lost my job my apartment I was losing my friends and I was pushing away my family and felt like I had nobody to turn to I was digging myself so deep into a hole that I thought I would never make it out of there not until thankfully about a year later I happened to reconnect with one of my older sisters she saw that I was at one of the lowest points in my life and she offered me some support what was so great is that she didn't
(08:47) shame me or force me to change instead she met me in my mess and asked how she could help she offered me a place to live and food to eat but only under one condition I had to get sober sober I wasn't sure if that was going to be possible in fact the word recovery was something that I had never used in my vocabulary before oh yeah and I had to live in her basement give her my car keys eat when she said I had to he eat and be home and she said I had to be home I felt like a child again but the truth is I had no other option at that point I no
(09:40) longer wanted to suffer so I dropped to my knees and I let go of the control I was done doing it my own way and I was done trying to figure it all out by myself I wanted to figure out what recovery meant to me and now I stand here before you today because of her unconditional love and God's grace that I was given a second chance at life something I used to never even believe in as I started to figure out what recovery meant to me it was in December of 2013 before I could even legally step foot in the bar at the age of 20 years
(10:37) old I found recovery and today I no longer say hi my name is Nadine and I am an addict instead today I am a person in long-term recovery and am proud of it today I will no longer allow my substance use and mental health disorders to define me today I no longer allow others to define me and while things didn't change overnight I realized that I had to put the work in I discovered that the only person who could really start making these changes in my life was me so I started to figure out what recovery meant to me I started
(11:30) leaning into the discomfort of my thoughts feelings and emotions I started diving into self-help books I started journaling and I started having uncomfortable conversations around Who I am and how I got here I started to surround myself with others who were willing to help me find a new way as I became more involved with the recovery community I got connected with the founders of an organization called rise together they were on a mission to stand up and speak out about their recovery but when they asked me to share
(12:11) my story for the very first time I said absolutely not speaking out about recovery from addiction was not something I ever imagined doing it was never in the five-year plan anyway not until February of 2014 I mustered up the courage to share my story publicly for the very first time in front of hundreds of students I stepped onstage that day and I was shaking my mouth was dry and I wasn't sure if I was even going to be able to make it through my speech but I took a deep breath I shared my story it was that day that my whole
(13:09) world started to change when I stepped off stage that day it's like this heavy weight was lifted off my shoulders I went home and I reflected on what had just happened and that's when I realized why I was put here on this earth I discovered that once I started to speak my truth I began to discover some light even through so much darkness that's when my question changed from why me - why not me and now I believe it is part of my purpose to share three and valuable lessons that have helped me to learn and believe that I am truly enough
(14:03) and it starts with forgiveness when I realized that I could be forgiven for the mistakes that I made in the past and for the horrible things I had done not only to myself but to others I started to feel whole again I don't have to wear a mask anymore today I have a real smile if I didn't find forgiveness I would have continued to live my life as a victim giving other people's actions power over me when I educate others around this topic people often feel like they can't find forgiveness but I promise you that
(14:57) finding forgiveness isn't about them it's about you the second is trust not just trusting in yourself or others but trusting the process trusting that whatever struggles you may be facing today could be leading you to something bigger and greater than you could have ever expected or imagined it's like that phrase walk by faith and not by sight I believe that that's the same when you walk with trust I would have never imagined that my addiction would lead me to sharing my story with people all around the world
(15:50) now that is trust and finally the third is acceptance for me it was accepting that even though I've made countless mistakes in my life I no longer believe that I am one and that's what matters I also discovered that once you start accepting who you are made to be by focusing on your strengths and things that you're good at your passion will naturally come into play it was through this acceptance that I am now helping to lead rise together and we have ignited a youth-led movement that is saving lives
(16:40) encouraging over a hundred and fifty thousand young people to use their voice and share their stories because at the end of the day we're all recovering from something but it's up to you to choose a different life it's up to you to find forgiveness trust and acceptance but this is a constant practice and it's not always easy in fact when I came to pitch my idea to TEDx about feeling good enough immediately when I was accepted I started to question whether I was good enough to talk about feeling good enough
(17:35) but this is my story this is my truth and I will continue to share it and not just for me because this was never just about me this is for you too this is for the thousands of individuals and beautiful people who no longer have a voice or a choice so if you're anything like me and you've had season after season of searching for the secret to being enough and you find yourself asking why me ask yourself instead why not me because we all are enough thank you 



“We can’t hate ourselves into a version of ourselves we can love.” ~Lori Deschene

Sometimes I am really terrible to myself, and I relentlessly compare myself to other people, no matter how many times I read or hear about how good enough or lovable I am.

On an almost daily basis, I meticulously look for evidence that I am a nobody, that I don’t deserve tobe loved, or that I’m not living up to my full potential.

There is generally a lot of pressure to “stack up” in our culture. We feel as if there is something wrong with us if, for example, we’re still single by a certain age, don’t make a certain amount of money, don’t have a large social circle, or don’t look and act a certain way in the presence of others. The list could truly go on forever.

Sometimes in the midst of all the pressure, I seem to totally forget all the wonderful, unique things about myself.

I get stuck in my head and allow myinner criticto completely tear apart my self-esteem until I hate myself too much to do anything except eat ice cream, watch daytime television, and sleep.

The other day, while I was beating myself up over something I can’t even recall at the moment, I read a comment from one of my blog readers telling me that one of my posts literally got them through the night. Literally. And if that one simple word was used in the intended context, this person was basically telling me that one of my posts saved their life.

I get comments like these on a pretty regular basis, and they always open my eyes to just how much I matter, regardless of my inner critic’s vehement objections.

Such comments also open my eyes to all the things we beat ourselves up over thatdon’tmatter—like whether or not we look like a Victoria’s Secret model in our bathing suit, or whether or not we should stop smiling if we’re not whitening our teeth, or whether or not the hole in our lucky shirt is worth bursting into tears over.

Lately I’ve been trying harder to catch myself when I feel a non-serving, self-depreciating thought coming on. And I may let these thoughts slip at times, but that’s okay because I’m only human.

While my self-love journey is ongoing, here are a few things I try to remember when I’m tempted to be mean to myself:

We all compare ourselves to other people, and I can assure you that the people who seem to have it all do not.

When you look at other people through a lens of compassion and understanding rather than judgment and jealousy, you are better able to see them for what they are—human beings. They are beautifully imperfect human beings going through the same universal challenges that we all go through.

I saw a quote once that read, “Don’t believe everything you think.” That quote completely altered the way I react when a cruel or discouraging thought goes through my mind. Thoughts are just thoughts, and it’s unhealthy and exhausting togive so much power to the negative ones.

This powerful reminder is inspired by one of my favorite quotes from Jon Kabat-Zinn: “Until you stop breathing, there’s more right with you than wrong with you.”

As someone who sometimes tends to zoom in on all my perceived flaws, it helps to remember that there are lots of things I like about myself too—like the fact that I’m alive and breathing and able to pave new paths whenever I choose.

This was a recent epiphany of mine, although I’m sure it’s been said many times before.

I find that it is most difficult to accept love and understanding from others when I’m in a state of anger, shame, anxiety, or depression. But adopting the above truth really shifted my perspective and made me realize that love is actually the greatest gift I can receive during such times.

One thing I’ve learned about making changes and reaching for the next rung on the ladder is that you cannot feel fully satisfied with where you’re going until you can accept, acknowledge, and appreciate where you are.

Embrace and make peace with where you are, and your journey toward something new will feel much more peaceful, rewarding, and satisfying.

One of the biggest causes of self-loathing is the hell-bent need to “get it right.” We strive for perfection and success, and when we fall short, we feel less than and worthless. What we don’t seem to realize is that working toward our goals and being willing to put ourselves out there are accomplishments within themselves, regardless of how many times we fail.

Instead ofberating yourself for messing upand stumbling backward, give yourself a pat on the back for trying, making progress, and coming as far as you have.

Telling yourself what a failure you are won’t make you any more successful. Telling yourself you’re not living up to your full potential won’t help you reach a higher potential. Telling yourself you’re worthless and unlovable won’t make you feel any more worthy or lovable.

I know it sounds almost annoyingly simple, but the only way to achieve self-love is to love yourself—regardless of who you are and where you stand, and even if you know you want to change.

You are enough just as you are. And self-love will be a little bit easier every time you remind yourself of that.

Feelings of inadequacy are something that most people will experience at some point in their lives.

It’s the nagging voice that tells us that we’re somehow not good enough, a loser, or not worthy of love and affection.

There is no truth in these thoughts, of course. But it’s difficult to accept that when you’re in the middle of a period of self-doubt or low self-esteem.

The following tips can help you manage your feelings of inadequacy and perhaps even shake them once and for all.

Just remember that this is a process that takes time and effort. So don’t be hard on yourself when you take a backward step or don’t see results straight away.

Aiming high and wanting to achieve big things in life is not a bad approach to take. It helps you to grow, learn, and reap the benefits that success can bring.

But ambition is less healthy when it is driven by a need to be the best at whatever you set out to do.

Invariably, you won’t be able to meet those lofty standards all the time, or even any of the time.

There will always be someone who is better at something or more successful in some regard.

If you find yourself disappointed that you aren’t at the pinnacle of whatever it is you wish to achieve, you’ll start to believe that you aren’t good enough, even if you are statistically better at something than 90% of the population.

Ease up on yourself a bit. Aim for excellence in some things, aim for satisfactory in others, but try not to aim for perfection in anything.

You’ll find yourself meeting your own expectations more often which will reinforce the message in your mind that you are a capable and sometimes talented individual who is ‘enough’ in anyone’s eyes.

And remember that there is a whole range of skills and talents out there, many of which are not going to be relevant to the goals you wish to achieve in life.

So don’t beat yourself up just because you can’t do something and you have to ask for help or pay someone to do it for you.

Sometimes that’s the best decision you can make, rather than using up your precious time struggling through a task when you could be doing something more productive.

Part of managing your expectations in terms of what you can achieve or how good you need to be at something is tostop comparing yourself to other people.

The big problem with doing so is that you focus exclusively on what they can do better than you or what they have that you don’t.

You rarely look at areas where you excel that they don’t, or what you have that they are probably envious of.

And because there are endless people to compare yourself to, it’s always possible to find at least one person who does a particular thing to a higher standard than you or who has something you don’t.

It’s impossible to rate every single element of a person’s life or every trait they have and come up with an overall score for them versus you. There are simply too many factors to consider and too much subjectivity involved.

It is far better to accept that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and that everyone’s life has some things but is missing others.

No one has it all. No one is good at everything.

If you compare your flaws and failures with someone else’s talents and successes, you will feel inadequate because you’re comparing apples with oranges.

It’s easy to persuade yourself that you are somehow “less than” other people if all you ever do is look at the things you don’t have or the things you haven’t yet accomplished.

By shifting your focus to your many achievements in life, you can change the overall perspective you have or yourself and your life.

Perhaps your career hasn’t taken off in the way you had hoped (yet!) but you graduated college or university which is a big thing. Okay, so maybe you didn’t always get top grades, but you kept going and got your qualifications.

Or maybe you dropped out of school but started you own business which now provides a reasonable living for you and your family.

Have you bought your own house?

Have you explored various parts of the world?

Have you had a child who you love and care for?

Have you been a part of a sports team that has won a cup or championship (at any level)?

Have you got your finances in order with money going into a pension, a good credit rating, and savings to fall back on?

Have you built something from scratch with your own two hands?

Have you created beautiful art that other people appreciate or even pay you for?

Look at your life over the years and you’ll see that you have achieved many things.

You might not be giving yourself the credit you deserve for them. Start doing that now.

Recognize that those are things of worth and that they reflect the person of worth that you are today.

Those achievements you’ve now got in mind from the previous point will be useful in turning around negative self-talk into something more positive.

Every time you think “I’m such a loser,” you can counter with an example of when you won.

Every time you think “I’m not good at anything,” you can challenge that thought with evidence of the things you excel at.

It’s all a case of examining a thought and asking whether it is true. When it comes to putting yourself down, it won’t be.

It’s easy to find reasons to beat yourself up, but by providing evidence to the contrary, you will start to realize that those negative thoughts are unfounded.

And by persistently taking this approach to self-talk, you will build up resilience against your own negativity. It will simply become a habit to fight the negative with the positive.

The more you do it, the more things you’ll have in your mental locker to challenge the negative thoughts when they arise.

You won’t dwell long on your feelings of inadequacy when you can quickly provide counter-evidence that proves you are more than adequate.

The way we talk about ourselves can be influenced by the way other people not only talk about us, but how they talk about others too.

If you spend time around someone who regularly puts you down, you’ll begin to believe the things they are saying about you.

That might be direct criticisms of you or something you have done, but it could also be indirect comments positioned as jokes or banter.

Even if they don’t talk specifically about you, they may discuss other people with you and say unkind things about them.

If they do, you’ll begin to see the world through this person’s harsh eyes. You’ll believe that everyone is looking at your flaws or shortcomings and start to see them yourself.

It’s difficult to feel like you are enough if the people around you are forever judging others.The underlying message of any judgment is that the person in question is not worthy of respect.

It’s sensible to take a really good look at the people you hang out with, whether that’s friends, family members, or colleagues. You might need to cut some of them out of your life altogether, whilst limiting the time you spend around others.

If you can’t help but see these people, just remind yourself that most people are not as bitter and hateful and that nobody of any importance is judging you so harshly.

The people who truly care about you accept you for who you are. They don’t expect perfection. They love you, warts and all.

If you have felt inadequate for some time and it is affecting how you live your life, it is a good idea to speak to a therapist.

The underlying cause of your feelings may need to be addressed if the other work in this article is to be effective.

Often, the negative views and thoughts we have about ourselves stem from our experiences earlier in life, particularly our childhood years.

Perhaps you were raised in an environment that lacked praise or recognition for the things you did well and where mistakes and flaws were highlighted instead.

Maybe you had todeal with constant rejectionfrom job applications when you first left education and this dented your self-worth.

Whatever the cause (or causes), by examining them with a trained professional, you can learn to undo the limiting beliefs put in place during that time and overcome the feelings you feel now.

It’s far harder to accept your own worth in this world if you focus too much on external things.

If you equate who you are with the amount of money you have, the type of house or car you can afford, the vacations you go on, or the possessions you own, you’re doing yourself an injustice.

The same goes for things like power or fame or popularity. These things are separate to the person you really are?

If you need convincing, just ask what would happen if all of those things were taken from you? Who would you be if you didn’t have the money or fame or whatever else?

You’d still be you. Your circumstances might be different, but your inner values would remain.

Examine what you truly value in life and compare it to what you think you should value based on what society most often promotes as a good life.

You’ll soon realize that things like inner peace, integrity, gratitude, and joy are what you really want.

In fact, we often chase those external things in the misguided belief that they will somehow give us the internal qualities we desire most.

But they won’t. They can’t. Whilst our internal world can be influenced by the external world, that external world cannot give or take anything away from our internal world.

Perhaps the only exception is thequalitypersonal relationships we have with others. When we share our lives with people who we care about and who care about us in return, our inner worlds will benefit.

By focusing on your inner world and the relationships you have with others, you will see that you are more than adequate, regardless of what your external circumstances are.

When you put your mind to something and set about doing that thing, it can be a wonderful boost to your self-belief when you achieve it.

It’s a way of proving to yourself that you are “good enough” to do that thing.

And when you regularly set and achieve goals of all sizes, you reinforce the message that you are not just adequate, but genuinely competent or skilled.

For a lasting reminder, keep a list of all the goals you’ve smashed and other things you have achieved. Whenever you feel inadequate, look at this list to give yourself a little boost.

Don’t simply focus on the end result, either. Make a point of valuing the process you went through, from learning new things to pushing beyond your comfort zone to overcoming obstacles.

The key is to set goals that you believe are realistic. They can be challenging, but they should be things that you are truly invested in and will see through to the end.

When you set yourself those goals in the previous point, you have to face the stark reality that you will fail to reach some of them.

But failure is a normal thing to experience. Everyone sets targets or goals or things they’d like to do. And everyone fails from time to time.

If you see those failures as terrible things and beat yourself up because of them, you’ll feed the feelings you have that you are somehow not good enough.

Instead, you need to be kind to yourself. You should remind yourself that failure is not always the end – sometimes it takes a few failed attempts before you finally succeed at something.

Failure teaches us lessons about what doesn’t work. It encourages us to look for different solutions or ways of achieving the things we set out to achieve.

A helpful way to approach your own failures is to consider what you would say to your best friend if they had failed at this exact same thing.

Would you tell them that they are useless or weak? Would you laugh at them or tell them that you were right to doubt them?

Of course you wouldn’t.

So why would you say those things to yourself?

Why wouldn’t you treat yourself with the same compassion and care that you would your friend when they fail?

Well, you can. It just takes a little switch in mentality. You have to catch yourself in the act of being unkind to yourself and remember that you are your own friend, and friend’s don’t say or think those things.

When people make decisions, they typically fall into one of two categories.

The first is that of a satisficer. This is a person who looks for a choice that satisfies their bare minimum requirements and then makes this choice without much further thought.

The second is that of a maximizer. This is a person who looks for the choice that will maximize what they get out of the thing they are choosing. They often spend long periods of time researching the choices and weighing up which is the best one.

So how does this relate to feelings of inadequacy?

Well, our lives are full of choices. We make them each and every day.

And every time we do, there is a chance that we will regret the choice we made.

Who do you think is going to doubt their choices the most? Probably a maximizer.

They want to make the best possible choice, which is hard to do all of the time. Sometimes what seems like the best choice at the time will turn out to be a less than optimal choice later on.

And when a choice turns out not to be the best one that could have been made, it’s easy to blame yourself and call yourself an idiot or some other unkind term.

But since a satisficer is happy to just have their minimum requirements met, they aren’t going to punish themselves if another option turns out to be better.

Stop worrying about making the perfect choice each and every time. If it’s not life or death, it’s probably not worth getting work up about.

It’s nice to receive a compliment or a thank you or any other kind words.

But are you really paying attention to these things? Because you should be.

When another person takes the time to say something nice about you or imply that you did something good, you should listen to them.

People don’t tend to say these things unless they are true. If other people see you as a good person who does good things, why would you doubt them?

It’s difficult to feel that you are not good enough when you have people telling you otherwise.

So take note of these nice comments – physically write them down or keep a digital note of them.

Whenever you are feeling a bit down on yourself, look back at your list for a quick pick-me-up.

Demonstrating that you are, in fact, good at things is another great way to deal with the sense of personal inadequacy.

So if there is a hobby that you enjoy doing where you are at the same or higher level than many of your peers, do that thing often.

Perhaps you let it slide because you had other things on your plate, or maybe you don’t do it as often as you’d like.

Whatever the case, if you can carve out more time to dedicate to this thing, it will give your self-belief and self-worth a natural boost.

Whether it’s drug or alcohol abuse, self-sabotage, social isolation, self-neglect, or something else, when you engage inself-destructive behavior, it will inevitably impact how you feel about yourself.

Taking steps to manage and overcome this behavior will not only alleviate its negative effects on you, it will give yourself something to be proud of.

If the challenge is a big one and you don’t feel able to tackle it alone, consult with a mental health professional or other expert to get help with it.

A sense of inadequacy can be the result of an underlying mental health issue – either one you are aware of or one that is undiagnosed.

If you believe this may be the case, your first stop should be a mental health professional who will be able to diagnose the issue and help you address it.

Have you ever struggled to feel good about yourself? Do you wonder if you’re good enough? Do you question whether you're competent enough? You may be dealing with feelings of inadequacy.

Feelings of inadequacy arise when we feel we’re not enough or not good enough. These feelings generally have nothing to do with our actual performance or abilities. In fact, these feelings may have a lot more to do with lowself-esteemor lowself-confidencethan any objective measure of ability or competence.

The American Psychological Association defines aninadequacy complex(more commonly known as aninferiority complex) as a feeling of inadequacy or insecurity coming from actual or imagined physical or psychological deficiencies. This feeling of being “less than” or “inferior to” others can often cause us to shut down (withdraw) or act aggressively depending on our coping styles.

People who feel inadequate may also experience the following things:

Keep in mind that we all feel these emotions to some extent. Some of us just feel more inadequate than others (Heidbreder, 1927).

If you’re feeling inadequate in general—or about something in particular—research shows that a number of strategies can help you feel better:

It’s totally normal to feel inadequate from time to time. If we work at it, we can reduce the amount of time we spend feeling this way and we can leave more room for self-confidence. Implementing any of these strategies can help you feel more competent and comfortable in situations that might produce inadequacy.

What can I do to improve my self-esteem?


How to improve your SELF-ESTEEM: the second step is the tricky part - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4-jd2JQlUI

Transcript:
(00:00) I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax Better Living Through psychology and the topic of today's short talk is how to improve your self-esteem so I've already done a similar episode on how to improve your self-confidence and now I'm turning my attention to self-esteem self-confidence and self-esteem are related but they're actually separate issues self-confidence is related to efficacy it's the belief that all other things being equal you can do something that you will be successful in the attempt on the other
(00:33) hand self-esteem is more like all other things being equal I feel good about who I am as a person as a human being unfortunately there are a lot of folks out there who struggle with self-esteem issues they may even be very successful and self-confident but they have low self-esteem nonetheless these folks don't think very highly of themselves and don't really feel good inside of their own skin fortunately there is a simple and effective way to improve your self-esteem but before I get into what that is please remember to like this
(01:09) episode And subscribe to this channel it takes less than a second costs you nothing and it's definitely an estimable action so do the thing so improving your self-esteem isn't that complicated the formula has two parts first you need to do difficult or steamable things and that kind of makes sense it's pretty hard to feel like you're a good person if you're not doing anything that you yourself would consider difficult or esteemable so pick a goal and go after it do something hard do something that you can be proud of
(01:52) having done people don't get genuine self-esteem from sitting on the couch and scrolling on social media they need to do difficult or steamable things and frankly you probably already knew this but here's the thing the first part is not enough you need to also do the second part and this is the part that's really neglected in today's day and age in order to develop self-esteem not only do you have to do difficult and esteemable things but you have to do difficult and esteemable things and not tell anyone about them
(02:32) that's the hard part in the age of social media so why is this important this is important because if you do something difficult or esteemable and then you share it with others then you substitute self-validation for external validation in fact you rob yourself of the opportunity for self-validation which is the basis of self-esteem you exchange your own internal satisfaction for praise views and likes and when you do that you're basically training your mind to understand that the reward for difficult or stingable action is the
(03:12) praise or validation of others and the longer you do that the more you will rely on external validation for your own self-regulation and the more you will need to prop up your own self-esteem with the praise of others taken to it is Extreme people are subject to becoming like validation junkies and this can be as addictive as any substance Addiction in fact we would call it a process addiction like gambling and it can lead to some very dark places so the idea here is to do difficult or esteemable things and not tell anyone
(03:48) about them this will give you the opportunity to validate and esteem yourself which is how you get self esteem and how do you do that well you kind of have to talk to yourself in a supportive and encouraging way like I'm proud of what I did today or I was scared but I did it anyway or I wanted to quit but I kept going good job Orion I know it sounds kind of cheesy but that's the kind of self-validation that facilitates the cultivation of healthy self-esteem then over time you'll find that you won't need as much external validation
(04:34) in fact you'll eventually become indifferent to both praise and sexual and this is an a supremely good thing why because if you're still emotionally influenced by whether people agree or disagree with you or like or don't like you or praise or censure you then you're still more or less a Slave and not just a slave but a slave with a million Masters by learning to validate ourselves sufficiently we can experience a kind of emotional manumission whereby we can emancipate ourselves from the slavery of
(05:13) external validation what do you think let me know your thoughts in the comments below and thank you for listening

It’s increasingly common for someone to be diagnosed with a condition such as ADHD or autism as an adult. A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers.

Verified byPsychology Today

PostedMarch 27, 2017|Reviewed by Lybi Ma

When it comes to your self-worth, only one opinion truly matters—your own. And even that one should be carefully evaluated; we tend to be our own harshest critics.

Glenn R. Schiraldi, Ph.D., author ofTheSelf-EsteemWorkbook, describes healthy self-esteem as a realistic, appreciative opinion of oneself. He writes, “Unconditional human worth assumes that each of us is born with all the capacities needed to live fruitfully, although everyone has a different mix of skills, which are at different levels of development.” He emphasizes that core worth is independent of externals that the marketplace values, such as wealth,education, health, status—or the way one has been treated.

Some navigate the world—and relationships—searching for any bit of evidence to validate their self-limiting beliefs. Much like judge and jury, they constantly put themselves on trial and sometimes sentence themselves to a lifetime of self-criticism.

Following are eight steps you can take to increase your feelings of self-worth.

1. Bemindful.

We can’t change something if we don’t recognize that there is something to change. By simply becoming aware of our negativeself-talk, we begin to distance ourselves from the feelings it brings up. This enables us to identify with them less. Without this awareness, we can easily fall into the trap of believing our self-limiting talk, and asmeditationteacher Allan Lokos says, “Don’t believe everything you think. Thoughts are just that—thoughts.”

As soon as you find yourself going down the path of self-criticism, gently note what is happening, be curious about it, and remind yourself, “These are thoughts, not facts.”

2. Change the story.

We all have a narrative or a story we’ve created about ourselves that shapes our self-perceptions, upon which our coreself-imageis based. If we want to change that story, we have to understand where it came from and where we received the messages we tell ourselves. Whose voices are we internalizing?

“Sometimes automatic negative thoughts like ‘you’re fat’ or ‘you’re lazy’ can be repeated in your mind so often that you start to believe they are true,” saysJessica Koblenz, Psy.D. “These thoughts are learned, which means they can beunlearned. You can start withaffirmations. What do you wish you believed about yourself? Repeat these phrases to yourself every day."

Thomas Boyce, Ph.D., supports the use of affirmations. Research conducted by Boyce and his colleagues has demonstrated that “fluency training” in positive affirmations (for example, writing down as many different positive things you can about yourself in a minute) can lessen symptoms ofdepressionas measured by self-report using theBeck Depression Inventory. Larger numbers of written positive statements are correlated with greater improvement. “While they have a bad reputation because of late-night TV,” Boyce says, “positive affirmations can help.”

3. Avoid falling into the compare-and-despair rabbit hole.

“Two key things I emphasize are to practice acceptance and stop comparing yourself to others,” says psychotherapistKimberly Hershenson, LMSW. “I emphasize that just because someone else appears happy onsocial mediaor even in person doesn’t mean they are happy. Comparisons only lead to negative self-talk, which leads toanxietyandstress.” Feelings of low self-worth can negatively affect your mental health as well as other areas in your life, such as work, relationships, and physical health.

4. Channel your inner rock star.

Albert Einstein said, “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” We all have our strengths and weaknesses. Someone may be a brilliant musician, but a dreadful cook. Neither quality defines their core worth. Recognize what your strengths are and the feelings ofconfidencethey engender, especially in times of doubt. It’s easy to make generalizations when you “mess up” or “fail” at something, but reminding yourself of the ways you rock offers a more realistic perspective of yourself.

Psychotherapist and certifiedsextherapistKristie Overstreet, LPCC, CST, CAP, suggests asking yourself, “Was there a time in your life where you had better self-esteem? What were you doing at that stage of your life?” If it’s difficult for you to identify your unique gifts, ask a friend to point them out to you. Sometimes it’s easier for others to see the best in us than it is for us to see it in ourselves.

5. Exercise.

Manystudieshave shown a correlation between exercise and higher self-esteem, as well as improved mental health. “Exercising creates empowerment both physical and mental,” saysDebbie Mandel,author ofAddicted to Stress, “especially weight lifting where you can calibrate the accomplishments. Exercise organizes your day around self-care.” She suggests dropping a task daily from your endless to-do list for the sole purpose of relaxation or doing something fun, and seeing how that feels. Other forms of self-care, such as propernutritionandsufficient sleep, have also been shown to have positive effects on one’s self-perception.

6. Do unto others.

Hershenson suggests volunteering to help those who may be less fortunate. “Being of service to others helps take you out of your head. When you are able to help someone else, it makes you less focused on your own issues.”

David Simonsen, Ph.D., LMFT, agrees:

“What I find is that the more someone does something in their life that they can be proud of, the easier it is for them to recognize their worth. Doing things that one can respect about themselves is the one key that I have found that works to raise one’s worth. It is something tangible. Helping at a homeless shelter, animal shelter, giving of time at a big brother or sister organization. These are things that mean something and give value to not only oneself, but to someone else as well.”

There is much truth to the fact that what we put out there into the world tends to boomerang back to us. To test this out, spend a day intentionally putting out positive thoughts and behaviors toward those with whom you come into contact. As you go about your day, be mindful of what comes back to you, and also notice if your mood improves.

7. Forgive.

Is there someone in your life you haven’t forgiven? An ex-partner? A family member? Yourself? By holding on to feelings of bitterness or resentment, we keep ourselves stuck in a cycle of negativity. If we haven’t forgiven ourselves,shamewill keep us in this same loop.

“Forgiving self and others has been found to improve self-esteem,” says Schiraldi, “perhaps because it connects us with our innately loving nature and promotes an acceptance of people, despite our flaws.” He refers to the Buddhist meditation onforgiveness, which can be practiced at any time: "If I have hurt or harmed anyone, knowingly or unknowingly, I ask forgiveness. If anyone has hurt or harmed me, knowingly or unknowingly, I forgive them. For the ways I have hurt myself, knowingly or unknowingly, I offer forgiveness."

8. Remember that you are not your circumstances.

Finally, learning to differentiate between your circumstances and who you are is key to self-worth. “Recognizing inner worth, and loving one’s imperfect self, provide the secure foundation for growth,” says Schiraldi. “With that security, one is free to grow with enjoyment, notfearof failure—because failure doesn’t change core worth.”

We are all born with infinite potential and equal worth as human beings. That we are anything less is a false belief that we have learned over time. Therefore, with hard work and self-compassion, self-destructive thoughts and beliefs can be unlearned. Taking the steps outlined above is a start in the effort to increase self-worth, or as Schiraldi says, to “recognizeself-worth. It already exists in each person.”

Harness the power of your thoughts and beliefs to raise your self-esteem. Start with these steps.

Low self-esteem can affect nearly every aspect of life. It can impact your relationships, job and health. But you can boost your self-esteem by taking cues from mental health counseling.

Consider these steps, based on cognitive behavioral therapy.

Think about the situations that seem to deflate your self-esteem. Common triggers might include:

Once you've learned which situations affect your self-esteem, notice your thoughts about them. This includes what you tell yourself (self-talk) and how you view the situations.

Your thoughts and beliefs might be positive, negative or neutral. They might be rational, based on reason or facts. Or they may be irrational, based on false ideas.

Ask yourself if these beliefs are true. Would you say them to a friend? If you wouldn't say them to someone else, don't say them to yourself.

Your initial thoughts might not be the only way to view a situation. Ask yourself whether your view is in line with facts and logic. Or is there another explanation?

Be aware that it can be hard to see flaws in your logic. Long-held thoughts and beliefs can feel factual even if they're opinions.

Also notice if you're having these thought patterns that erode self-esteem:

Now replace negative or untrue thoughts with positive, accurate thoughts. Try these strategies:

You might also try these steps, based on acceptance and commitment therapy.

Again, think about the conditions or situations that seem to deflate your self-esteem. Then pay attention to your thoughts about them.

Repeat your negative thoughts many times. The goal is to take a step back from automatic thoughts and beliefs and observe them. Instead of trying to change your thoughts, distance yourself from them. Realize that they are nothing more than words.

Instead of resisting or being overwhelmed by negative thoughts or feelings, accept them. You don't have to like them. Just allow yourself to feel them.

Negative thoughts don't need to be controlled, changed or acted upon. Aim to lessen their power on your behavior.

These steps might seem awkward at first. But they'll get easier with practice. Recognizing the thoughts and beliefs that affect low self-esteem allows you to change the way you think about them. This will help you accept your value as a person. As your self-esteem increases, your confidence and sense of well-being are likely to soar.

In addition to these suggestions, remember that you're worth special care. Be sure to:

Self-judgment and self-rejection can be extremely damaging.

We may find ourselves taking fewer career risks, withdrawing from social engagements, and even avoiding making new friends (McKay & Fanning, 2016).

Research has shown self-esteem to be a powerful internal monitor of the degree to which our “need for social inclusion is satisfied or threatened” (Orth & Robins, 2019, p. 336).

Self-esteem is vital for our psychological wellbeing, and its absence is likely to leave many basic needs unfulfilled (McKay & Fanning, 2016).

This article explores what we mean by self-esteem and introduces techniques and tools to develop it further.

Before you continue, we thought you might like todownload our three Self-Compassion Exercises for free. These detailed, science-based exercises will not only help you increase the compassion and kindness you show yourself, but also give you the tools to help your clients, students, or employees show more compassion to themselves.

While researchers have long been fascinated bywhat self-esteem is, how it first emerges in childhood, and how it changes across our lifespan, only in the last couple of decades has a more precise understanding begun to emerge (Orth & Robins, 2019).

Self-esteem is a subjective construct, well suited to being measured through self-report. It does not necessarily offer anobjectivereflection of a person’s competencies, characteristics, or even how others see them.

Typically, researchers distinguish between global and domain-specific self-esteem.Globally,it relates to how the individual evaluates their worth, whiledomain-specificityindicates feelings of worth in a single area, such as physical appearance, relationships, and intellectual capability (Orth & Robins, 2019).

Although research suggests global self-esteem is influenced by both genetic (approximately 40%) and environmental factors, it remains unclear exactly how it emerges in early life (Orth & Robins, 2019).

While one bottom-up view suggests self-esteem arises as a child forms beliefs about their talents in specific domains, another proposes it evolves from early experiences of meaningful interpersonal relationships.Self-esteem researchrecognizes the importance of the family environment, including the quality of the parental relationship (Orth & Robins, 2019).

Self-esteem varies across situations and age; much of the research suggests it is low in childhood, increasing in adolescence, at its maximum in adulthood, then reducing in old age. However, it remains relatively stable throughout our lives in relation to others, and “the evidence supports the notion that self-esteem is an enduring personality characteristic” (Orth & Robins, 2019, p. 331).

Unless we focus on changing it, if we are insecure as children, we are likely to be so in adulthood.

We all differ in how our self-esteem changes over time. Much of these individual differences are influenced, sometimes indirectly, by the following factors (Orth & Robins, 2019):

For example, the influence of gender on self-esteem is small and typically reduces as adolescents move into adulthood (Ramachandran, 2012). Any effect of gender on self-esteem is also, most likely, indirect. In some cultures, women are given lower status, and in some situations, women are treated differently in work and educational environments (Orth & Robins, 2019).

Social relationships have a considerable impact on our self-esteem. “Self-esteem is an internal monitor of the degree to which the individual’s need for social inclusion is satisfied or threatened” (Orth & Robins, 2019, p. 336).

Orth and Robins (2019) describe a series of documentary films that followed 14 British children throughout their lives from the age of seven.

Every seven years, the children were interviewed up until they reached middle age.

At seven years old, one of the participants, Suzy, was a heartfelt young child, very capable of expressing enthusiasm and pleasure in her life. By the age of 14, she had become withdrawn, stepping back from what interested and excited her as a young child.

By 49, having led a turbulent life, she expressed “regret that she failed to take responsibility for herself in life and develop a stronger sense of her self-worth” (Orth & Robins, 2019, p. 328).

It seems a romantic relationship in her 20s had led Suzy’s life satisfaction and self-esteem to soar, but a rollercoaster life thereafter had led to many ups and downs, impacting her degree of self-esteem.

The story of a young entomologist is taken up by Matthew McKay and Patrick Fanning (2016) in their bestselling bookSelf-Esteem. During job interviews, the entomologist would make bold judgments about the interviewers based on how they were dressed. And when asked questions, he would weigh up what he believed they wanted to hear against a continuous, self-critical monologue.

He had listened to this voice for years. “That was a stupid answer […] you’re a fraud […] do something!” By the end of the interviews, his self-esteem would be through the floor. Having tuned out, his answers became increasingly vague; he developed a slight stammer and had all but given up (McKay & Fanning, 2016, p. 19).

While it may seem that our self-critic can be beyond our control, that is not the case. The problem is that we are so used to listening to it that we forget how to turn it off; however, wecanchange (McKay & Fanning, 2016).Download 3 Free Self-Compassion Exercises (PDF)These detailed, science-based exercises will equip you to help others create a kinder and more nurturing relationship with themselves.Download PDFDownload 3 Free Self-Compassion Tools Pack (PDF)By filling out your name and email address below.NameEmail Address(Required)Your Expertise(Required)Your expertiseTherapyCoachingEducationCounselingBusinessHealthcareOtherNameThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

When we learn to switch off or refute our inner critic, we can stop the cycle ofself-sabotageand regain control before harming our sense of self-esteem and self-worth.

Importantly, research suggests that therapy can increase clients’ sense ofself-worth; they begin to see themselves as more deserving and capable (McKay & Fanning, 2016).

Along with cognitive restructuring, which we discuss below, many techniques can help defeat the inner critic, including:

Discussing each problem in therapy and exploring and practicing strategies that help reframe our beliefs can be enormously influential in managing and developing self-esteem.

Ethan Kross (2021) describes our internal monologue, when harmful, as chatter.

It is made up of the “cyclical negative thoughts and emotions that turn our singular capacity for introspection into a curse rather than a blessing” (Kross, 2021, p. xix).

Feeling depressed or generally down on ourselves is often the product of our inner critic. It can, therefore, be helpful to catch self-criticism in the act.

Try the following steps (modified from McKay & Fanning, 2016):

What are those thoughts saying to you?Try to remember when those feelings began.What was the critic saying then?

Regularly performing this exercise will help you become more familiar with the content of your inner critic’s attacks.

Once you know how your inner criticism can be damaging and when it typically occurs, it is possible to challenge it.

Talking back to your critic may seem a little odd, but learning to reject your negative programming is incredibly valuable.

When you observe your inner critic at work, try the following two talking back methods (McKay & Fanning, 2016):

Ask yourself, what price am I paying for the attacks by my inner critic?Create a list of what your inner critic costs you.

For example:I avoid socializing with new people.I constantly think people at work don’t respect me.

Combine the points into statements that you can use to challenge the critic:

I can’t afford this; you are costing me my social life and damaging my career.

To disarm the critic, especially with deeply held negative beliefs, you must learn to replace its voice with “a positive awareness of your own worth” (McKay & Fanning, 2016, p. 42).

And it’s not easy. You need to challenge long-held beliefs, and recognize you are valuable as a human being.

McKay and Fanning (2016, p. 42) offer the following affirmation examples:

I am worthwhile because I breathe and feel and am aware.I feel pain, I love, and I try to survive. I am a good person.

Your aim is to create a statement that feels authentic for you, one you can use to replace your inner critic.

The cognitive model associated with Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) proposes that dysfunctional thinking exists in all psychological disturbances. A person’s emotional state and behavior can be helped when they “learn to evaluate their thinking in a more realistic and adaptive way” (Beck, 2011, p. 3).

While there are manytools and techniques to improve self-esteem, cognitive restructuring techniques have proven rapid and highly effective.

McKay and Fanning (2016, p. 6) suggest “an exploration of chronic self-talk, a systematic confrontation of cognitive distortions, and the development of a more accurate and compassionate self-evaluation” to elevate a client’s sense of self-worth.

The therapist begins by exploring the client’s thoughts.What were you thinking or saying to yourself at that time?

It can be helpful for the client to give a name to their inner critic. Providing the voice with an identity means it can be externalized and experienced as an external factor rather than ‘me.’

The client should also be introduced to their healthy voice (their ‘accepting’ or ‘rational’ agent), the one who thinks realistically.

Through helping the client see the dichotomy, it is possible to challenge their harshest critic (themselves) using theirhealthy voice.

Next, the client should be helped to recognize why they use their critical voice and how it may appear to protect them. For example:

What was the critic saying when you were meeting new people?What do you think the critic was trying to protect you from?How was the critic doing this?

Perhaps the critic was preparing you for rejection or protecting you by encouraging you not to engage.

Once the critic’s function is better understood, it is possible to ask the client what they would be forced to experience if the critic weren’t stopping or limiting them (McKay & Fanning, 2016).

How does the critic help you in this or other similar situations?What are you scared might happen if the critic were silenced?

The client can learn what reinforces the inner critic and how some of their important needs can be met in healthier ways (McKay & Fanning, 2016).

Distorted ways of thinking can also lower our self-esteem. By identifying the many types of distortion, they become easier to spot, and it becomes possible to replace toxic language with something more accurate.

Socratic questioningcan be a powerful way to expose logical inconsistencies in what is being said and produce a more accurate statement (modified from McKay & Fanning, 2016):

Such questioning reveals that our inner voice is not only inaccurate, but incorrect, and there are healthier ways to view our performances and behavior.

Over time, the client can learn to confront distortions every time they hear them. By challenging them duringself-esteem therapy, it can become easier to fight them in real-world scenarios (McKay & Fanning, 2016).

The following worksheets and workbooks can be useful to assess and improve self-esteem.

It is necessary to catch the critic early to build and maintain self-esteem.

It requires vigilance, especially when meeting strangers, people you find attractive, situations where you have made a mistake, and when you risk failure or rejection (McKay & Fanning, 2016).

TheCatching Your Criticexercise can help you recognize that inner critic. You should begin to understand when you are most critical and when you need to challenge or reign in your inner critic.

Vigilance is crucial in handling cognitive distortions. Once identified, we can refute them (McKay & Fanning, 2016).

TheThree Column Techniqueis helpful for the identification and rebuttal of cognitive distortion when a situation makes you feel depressed or discouraged.

TheDiscovering and Revising Your Should’shelps you recognize the statements that define how you feel youshouldbehave and then consider their positives and negatives.

If the‘should’is undermining your self-esteem, and the negatives outweigh the positives, then it needs to be cut from your internalself-talk(McKay & Fanning, 2016).

TheBeing Realistic About Your Weaknessesworksheet can help you take a fresh look at the qualities you consider weaknesses without using them as instruments for destructive self-attacks that damage your self-esteem (modified from McKay & Fanning, 2016).

When our self-esteem is low, it can be difficult to ask for what we want or need.

TheWants Into Wordsworksheet can help you prepare in advance by constructing an assertive request (modified from McKay & Fanning, 2016).

Goal setting is invaluable in all aspects of our lives. It is particularly beneficial when areas of our life feel bad.

TheGoal Setting for Self-Esteemworksheet can help you capture aspects of your life that currently feel bad and assign goals to fix them or reduce their impact.

One of the most widely used and well-validated measures of self-esteem is theRosenberg Self-Esteem Scale.

The questionnaire contains 10 items (five positively worded and five negatively worded), scored on a Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree (University of Maryland Department of Sociology, 2021).

Prompts include:

I feel that I have a number of good qualities.I feel that I do not have much to be proud of.On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.

Our sense of self –who we are– is based on our identity. It builds on our self-understanding,self-concept(basic beliefs about who we are), and, crucially, our self-esteem (Ramachandran, 2012).

Whileself-understandingsuggests a degree of self-knowledge, and self-concept indicates basic beliefs about who we are,“self-esteem refers to an individual’s subjective evaluation of his or her worth as a person” (Orth & Robins, 2019, p. 329).

And it’s crucial. As McKay and Fanning (2016, p. 1) wrote, “self-esteem is essential for psychological survival,” and without it, our basic needs are likely to go unmet.

While our genes influence self-esteem, it can be transformed by external circumstances and influences, including parenting and therapy. Indeed, cognitive therapy has been shown to raise self-esteem by changing clients’ beliefs and how they interpret life.

Try some of the self-esteem exercises, activities, and worksheets with your clients. They are powerful tools to help them recognize their positive and negative beliefs and cognitive distortions, and identify ways to adopt a less-critical view of themselves.

Hi Jeremy,I am a psychotherapist and trying to help my own daughter with self-esteem. She has grown up in a very loving family I don’t understand why she criticizes herself a lot. Your article came out like medicine to me although I practice most of them with my clients. I just want to say that I noticed we need to be careful when we accept compliments. There is a risk of living on the compliments. If we don’t get any compliments about something that day we may feel down.

Why do I always feel insecure?



For People Feeling Insecure - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JtnxWhIzSE

Transcript:
(00:01) i've always kind of been a weird kid i know i don't show that side of me on my channel too much but i'm definitely pretty weird i'll geek over computer hardware over anime and a lot of the times you can just catch me making really weird noises and dancing in ways that i definitely should not be dancing it's just like it doesn't there's there's no time for it in my videos when i'm talking about self-help stuff but now finally a video is related to it like don't you ever look at a custom
(00:27) built pc and just all the rgb lights and the specs of it once you hear those specs you're like you gonna make me act up wow the things that i tell you guys on this channel but for the longest time i used to hide these parts of me because i wanted to be liked i was extremely insecure with them because it wasn't what most people liked or thought was cool especially during my teenage years and kind of start of college years these are the years where people really want to fit in and be part of the right click
(00:59) but if there's one thing that i've learned over the years it's that if you try to be liked by everybody you will be liked by nobody nobody likes a people pleaser and in fact if you try to be a people pleaser you'll always be insecure because you're never actually resolving those issues those insecurities that you have by doing that in this video i'm not going to teach you how to remove your insecurities i'm going to teach you the opposite of that i'm going to teach you why they're
(01:26) actually a really amazing thing why i love my insecurities and how i became confident through them [Music] so first i want to go over the three most common causes of insecurities because when you get a better understanding as to why you feel insecure when the situation arises again you can identify which one of these causes it is and it allows you to deal with them better and then i'm gonna explain to you what's helped me really love those parts about myself that i used to be super insecure about that don't need changing
(02:00) that aren't toxic but just make me who i am and by the end of this video you should be viewing insecurities from a different point of view the first and probably most common cause of insecurity is due to recent rejection or failure i vividly remember one job that i applied to it was a startup back in my hometown in buffalo new york and i remember just walking into the job i don't remember the exact role but i was so confident walking in and they sat me down for my interview i got along with them really well they
(02:31) were in the memes and memeing i'm into memeing we were talking about having fun in the office which a lot of startups like to do and i thought i had this in the bag i thought that these guys liked me so much there was no way that i wasn't gonna get this job and with that confidence i went into the test part of this application process on a different day and i didn't do too well on it and i knew that i didn't but i walked out of it still feeling like i had a great chance of getting the job and lo and behold a few weeks passed and
(03:01) then i get an email saying i did not get the job and my confidence got completely ruined for quite a while after that just because i got rejected from one job recent events in our lives like rejection from a job or a person can make us feel way worse about ourselves than we actually feel like and sometimes they can be so painful that we never come back from them and we always feel that insecurity because of that one event so i am going to teach you how to really never feel that again the second insecurity i see a lot and that happened
(03:34) with me a lot is a lack of confidence due to social anxiety now i remember in almost any social situation when i was younger a few years back i would over evaluate every single little thing that i was saying if i said the right thing if i am standing the right way do i look okay i was so overly paranoid with what i looked like or what i was doing as if anyone really cared about that it's something i couldn't get over at all when i used to smoke weed and it's one of the reasons why i quit you know you're in those social situations
(04:06) people are doing it around you you want to feel included so you're like yeah i'll take a few hits of that i would always do this and then i would immediately regret it afterwards because i couldn't socialize afterwards so the reason that i smoked weed was to socialize and it did the exact opposite for me and i'm glad that i figured that out finally and maybe you guys can relate to that too or maybe that's just me but the third reason that you are probably insecure is insecurity driven by perfectionism
(04:35) now i'm a bit of a perfectionist myself not as much as i used to be but i do feel down on myself when i feel like my creative work isn't at the tip top shape that it could be and as a result i would beat myself up for this when it was completely unjustified i made something really great but i just didn't feel like it was good enough [Music] okay we understand the common causes of insecurity now comes the transformation now comes the time where i'm going to make you really love these things about yourself
(05:12) and conquer the insecurities that you need to when talking about transforming or conquering insecurities there's two different types that require two different ways of looking at them and two different types of action and the first one is like i was talking about those insecurities that you can't really change about yourself like me loving anime and loving geeking out on technology that stuff that isn't actually harmful towards you that most people just don't really like in normal people terms i don't know so
(05:42) what helped me with these types of insecurities is just viewing them as a really beautiful thing i have something that no one else has i have the ability to produce pitches with my voice that no one else can do even if they are super super cringy that is an indispensable asset that you have you have a thing that makes you unique different from everybody else and for some reason you're viewing that as a bad thing and i get it because a lot of the things that we don't like about ourselves are things that society
(06:18) most people in society at least don't like or consider to be cool the only reason you don't view this thing in a positive manner is because it's not the social standard of what is cool so a bunch of humans came together and decided you know what we're gonna choose this to be what's cool and this to be what is not cool i bet in a completely different alternate universe doing cringy [ __ ] would make me the coolest [ __ ] on the planet and that means it's not even you that really thinks these things aren't
(06:47) good things about yourself it's your view on it based upon the social construct behind it and when i realize that i just laugh myself silly a social construct it's not even a real thing that i'm worried about but you know sometimes societal norms are right i don't want you to steer into thinking that all societal norms are wrong so let's talk about this other type of insecurity which is the one that i think plagues people more the insecurity that is based on you getting rejected or bullied in the
(07:17) past about something and how to conquer that or feel better about that you feel like you haven't done enough with your life you don't have enough money or friends or accolades i've been there nothing feels worse than feeling like you don't belong or you're not good enough but you don't need money status or friends to be more secure some of the most confident dudes i know aren't in shape they don't talk about self-improvement they don't give a [ __ ] about it they don't get girls they don't have a
(07:46) lot of money and yet they are some of the most confident people that i know it's because they understand these two central ideas and when i understood these i realized you know i can do anything and feel confident about it no matter how bad i am at that thing and the two ideas are that everything is impermanent and that no one is thinking about yourself more than you and along with that they've done something else but i want to talk about this first so i've talked about this idea before but let me reiterate here
(08:14) for the people who haven't seen my why you care so much video everything is impermanent everybody eventually is going to die one day everybody is eventually going to be six feet under we all go to the same place and that means that every mistake or rejection or failure that you make is never actually gonna be permanent it just feels so awful in the moment of course it does it feels like the end of the world when we get rejected or we fail at something but we need these things in our lives to become better humans
(08:49) when i'm scared to go up to a girl to talk to her to get her number or something or scared to do something in public like i used to have such a big fear of filming myself and vlogging in public but the one thing i always keep in my mind before i'm about to do said thing that i'm insecure about doing is that okay i put this in my head i have a state of mind where i'm like nothing's permanent even if this goes horribly wrong it's okay they're not going to really care i'm the only one that's going to care
(09:18) and this ties into the second central idea that no one thinks about you more than yourself after those people get a nice laugh out of you filming or doing something stupid in public they go about with their day and start thinking about their insecurities all day nobody is thinking about yourself more than you and here's the thing about those people that i was talking about that are just so confident and don't have any sort of status or they get rejected a bunch of times the thing that separates them from people who are super insecure
(09:49) is the fact that they've practiced rejection and failure so many times that they're pretty much immune to it it has to become a practice you want to actively put yourself in situations that are going to be embarrassing to you because eventually after you do that so many times it'll feel totally natural you've already experienced this before and you're gonna be like okay this is nothing to me embrace that rejection embrace that failure because if you fail at something or you get rejected by someone
(10:17) you are one step closer to being the person or being with the person that you're truly meant to be with these people that are less insecure than you have failed at more things and gotten rejected more than you think about that and embrace the weird [ __ ] about yourself because that stuff is dope wow how do i make a video like this that doesn't sound so corny i don't know i mean i hope that this helped you guys and thank you very much for watching this video if you did enjoy it leave a like for me look at that my
(10:48) monitor just turned off right on time beautiful love it i love you guys for watching till the end and thank you so much for all the continued support on the channel if you like my videos subscribe and you'll have a video right here to check out and you know hopefully that one helps you too and hopefully if you didn't like this one and maybe it helps you more than this one so hopefully you check it out all right i'm gonna go i'll i'll see you guys



How to Deal with Insecurities? | Sadhguru - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKofIMo_2B0

Transcript:
(00:00) Sadhguru: You are living on a daily basis as if you are forever. The fundamental awareness that this is mortal, if you come to terms with that one thing, there will be no insecurity, because there is nothing to gain, nothing to lose in this life. You came with nothing – whatever the hell is happening, you are on the profit side.
(00:25) Participant: Sadhguruji, my question is, how does one deal with insecurities? Sadhguru: How does one deal with insecurity? Life is insecure. There is no security about life because... shall I reveal a secret to you? Hmm? Participants: Yes. Sadhguru: However young and healthy you are, you are going to die one day.
(00:55) I will bless you with a long life, but you will die one day. Is it okay? No? [Laughter] So, you can die joyfully, or you can die crying – it's up to you. But anyway you'll die one day. Yes, or no? Participants: Yes. If you say "I don't want to die," today you start the chanting, ‘I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die.
(01:26) ’ All that will happen is, you will not live, but you will die. [Laughter] Yes? The fear ‘I don't want to die’ will make you not live, but it will not make you not die – anyway you will die. Coming to terms with mortality is one very important thing. If you don't come to terms with mortality, you're living in a fancy world, of unreal world, not in the real world.
(02:02) The real world is, we come and go. So many countless number of people have come and gone before us, isn't it? You're... [Laughs] you're in an institution from 1857. I was just wondering how they started an institution in that year, because in that year there was such turmoil all over the country.
(02:27) Hmm? 1857. A lot of upheaval in the country, but somehow, somebody managed to start an institution. The soil that you're walking upon, we don't know how many people are buried. Yes, or no? All these countless number of people who walked this planet before you and me, where are they? They are all topsoil.
(03:01) Yes, or no? Participants: Yes. Sadhguru: This will also become topsoil one day, unless your friends choose to bury you real deep [Laughter] fearing you may raise from the dead. [Laughter] There have been certain instances. This happened. There was an old couple in Texas over 75 years of age. It was their dream to go to the Holy Land, or the Jerusalem.
(03:33) But because of business, and then children, children growing up, going to the university, and their marriages, and da da da... they never made it. When they're over 75 years of age they made the trip to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is a place where every cobblestone reeks of history. So, they walked that pathway where Jesus is supposed to have walked, they went to that place where he's supposed to have walked on the water, and many things like this.
(04:08) They were overwhelmed by this whole experience, and unfortunately the lady had a heart attack, and she died. Then the man was preparing to take her body back to Texas. But then the local people approached and said, "See, Jerusalem is the Holy Land. This is the right place to die. She's done the right thing.
(04:34) So, let's do all the rituals here, and bury her here. And it just costs you $25,000. Because if you take her back to Texas, just the transportation costs $18,000. And local charges, and in America the cemetery charges are very heavy, all this put together, you will spend much more money, and above all, she has chosen to die in the Holy Land.
(05:06) This is where she must be buried, let's do it." The man said, "No, I'm taking her back to Texas." They said, "See, you are very distressed because of your wife's death. You are not able to think straight, we can understand. So, we will give you a super discount: $15,000.
(05:27) " This is a haggling place, you know? "Let's do it!" The man thought about it, and he said, "No. I will take her back to Texas." Then they said, "See, it doesn't make sense. I can see you're very distressed. You lost your wife of 45 years, so obviously you are very, very distressed, you are not thinking straight at all, we can understand this.
(05:53) Just because of that, you are an American, and you are from Texas, so, we give you an absolute super, super discount: $10,000 – let's do it. Come on, let's do it, let's do it." What I'm talking, if you want to understand, you must go to Kashi, or someplace, how these things happen, you know? [Laughs] Then the man thought about it and he said, "No, I'm taking her back to Texas.
(06:20) " And they threw their hands up and said, "Why? What's the problem with you? $10,000 – let's do it." He said, "See, in Texas, dead stay dead." [Laughter] So... if you come to terms with your mortality, security, insecurity, all these things will go. You are living on a daily basis as if you are forever.
(07:04) The fundamental awareness that this is mortal, this is here only for a limited amount of time, if this was, you know, a normal, conscious thing for you, you would put your life to best use, for sure. And if you come to terms with that one thing, there would be no insecurity, because there is nothing to gain, nothing to lose in this life.
(07:31) You came with nothing – whatever the hell is happening, you are on the profit side. Yes, or no? Hmm? Isn't it so? Did you come with investment? No. You come with nothing, so whatever the hell is happening, you are always on the profit side, isn't it? And anyway, they don't allow you to take a container in the end.
(07:57) So, all you have is, how profound, intense and beautiful is your experience of life. So, don't make too much fuss about it. You are acting as if you are going to lose something. No. There is nothing to lose, nothing to gain, because you come and you go. Y
(08:18) ou may think, "Oh, my life, my life..." No, your life on this planet is like a pop-up. On the computer screen, you have seen these pop-ups? You are just a pop-up and pop-out. [Laughter] In the meantime, will you rise and shine is the only question, all right? So, if anyway you shine, sometimes you may be seen by people, sometimes you may not be seen by people.
(08:39) The important thing is, you are shining within yourself, and that's all that matters. If people have eyes they will see it, if they have no eyes they won't see it, that's their problem, but you are living an intense and profound life – that is all that matters here. If you understand this, and if you bring this into your life, insecurity will not happen because security can happen only in death.
(09:07) Yes, or no? People keep asking me, coming to me and asking me, "Sadhguru, please bless us, nothing should happen to us." I say, "Hey, what kind of blessing is this? My blessing is, let everything happen to you!" [Laughter] Everything that's life must happen to you. Have you come here to avoid life, or have you come here to experience life? Please, you must make a decision right now.
(09:32) Have you come here to avoid life, or to experience life? Experience life. All the different dimensions of what this life holds must happen to you, isn't it so? If you come to avoid life, there's an ocean right here, you can jump into the ocean. See, if you want to avoid life, you must die. It's a more efficient way of doing things, isn't it? You're alive and you try to avoid life – it will become miserable.
(10:04) If you feel insecure, that's what you will do: you will try to avoid life. When you're alive and try to avoid life, it will cause immense misery. When you're alive, you live. When you die, you die – don't get up from the dead. [Laughter]




We are called a narcissistic generation. We are told that technology and social media are giving us an inflated sense of self. But most of us don’t walk around feeling like we are all that great. In fact, there is one underlying emotion that overwhelmingly shapes our self-image and influences our behavior, and that is insecurity. If you could enter the minds of people around you, even the narcissistic ones, you’re likely to encounter ceaseless waves of insecurity. A recentsurveyfound that 60 percent of women experience hurtful, self-critical thoughts on a weekly basis.

In their research, father-and-daughter psychologists Drs. Robert and Lisa Firestone used an assessment tool known as the Firestone Assessment for Self-Destructive Thoughts (FAST) to evaluate people’s self-attacks (or “critical inner voices”) along a continuum. What they found is that the most common self-critical thought people have toward themselves is that they are different – not in a positive sense, but in some negative, alienating way. Whether our self-esteem is high or low, one thing is clear; we are a generation that compares, evaluates and judges ourselves with great scrutiny. By understanding where this insecurity comes from, why we are driven to put ourselves down and how this viewpoint affects us, we can start to challenge and overcome the destructive inner critic that limits our lives.

There is an internal dialogue that accompanies our feelings of insecurity. This is called the “critical inner voice.” Dr. Lisa Firestone, who co-authored the bookConquer Your Critical Inner Voicewrote, “The critical inner voice is formed out of painful early life experiences in which we witnessed or experienced hurtful attitudes toward us or those close to us. As we grow up, we unconsciously adopt and integrate this pattern of destructive thoughts toward ourselves and others.”

So, what events or attitudes shape this inner critic? The experiences we have with our influential early caretakers can be at the root of our insecurity as adults. Imagine a child being yelled at by a parent. “You’re so spaced out! Can’t you figure anything out on your own?” Then, imagine the negative comments and attitudes parents express toward themselves. “I look terrible in this. I’m so fat.” These attitudes don’t even have to be verbalized to influence the child. A parent’s absence can leave children feeling insecure and believing there is something fundamentally wrong with them. An intrusive parent can cause children to become introverted or self-reliant in ways that make them feel insecure or untrusting of others.Studieshave even shown that exaggerated praise can be damaging to a child’s self-esteem.

The reason for this is that children must feel seen for who they are in order to feel secure. A lot of our issues with insecurity can come from our early attachment style.Dr. Daniel Siegel, author ofParenting from the Inside Out, says the key to healthy attachment is in the four S’s, feeling safe, seen, soothed and secure. Whether children are being shamed or praised, they are, most likely, not feeling seen by the parent for who they really are. They may start to feel insecurity and lose a sense of their actual abilities.

A healthy attitude for parents to maintain is to see themselves and their children realistically and to treat them with acceptance and compassion. The best way a parent can support their children is to allow them to find something that is unique to them – something that lights them up and that they will work to achieve. This activity must appeal to the child’s interest, not just the parents. As author and civil rights leader Howard Thurman famously said, ““Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.”

As the child pursues whatever interest makes them “come alive,” the parent should offer support and acknowledgment for the effort involved as opposed to focusing too much on the result. It’s the difference between saying “What a stunning picture. You are the best artist I’ve seen” and saying, “I love the way you used so many colors. It’s awesome that you worked so hard on this. What gave you that idea?” This practice helps a child establish a sense of self-worth.

It’s clear that there are many things that shape our critical inner voice, from negative attitudes directed toward us to attitudes our parents had toward themselves. As we get older, we internalize these points of view as our own. We keep these attitudes alive by believing in our insecurities as we go along in life. The most common critical inner voices Dr.’s Robert and Lisa Firestone found people to experience throughout their day include:

Like a mean coach, this voice tends to get louder as we get closer to our goals. “You’re gonna screw up any minute. Everyone will realize what a failure you are. Just quit before it’s too late.” Oftentimes, we react to these thoughts before we even realize we are having them. We may grow shy at a party, pull back from a relationship, project these attacks onto the people around us or act out toward a friend, partner or our children. Just imagine what life would be like if you didn’t hear any of these mean thoughts echo in your head. Imagine what reality might actually look like if you could live free of this prescribed insecurity.

Insecurity can affect us in countless areas of our lives. Every person will notice their inner critic being more vocal in one area or another. For example, you may feel pretty confident at work but completely lost in your love life or vice versa. You may even notice that when one area improves, the other deteriorates. Most of us can relate, at one time or another, to havingself-sabotagingthoughts toward ourselves about our career. Old feelings that we are incompetent or that we will never be acknowledged or appreciated can send our insecurities through the roof. Some common critical inner voices about one’s career include:

Whether we are single, dating or in a serious, long-term relationship, there are many ways our critical inner voice can creep in to our romantic lives. Relationships, in particular, can stir up past hurts and experiences. They can awaken insecurities we’ve long buried and bring up emotions we don’t expect. Moreover, many of us harbor unconsciousfears of intimacy. Being close to someone else can shake us up and bring these emotions and critical inner voices even closer to the surface. Listening to this inner critic can do serious damage to our interpersonal relationships. It can cause us to feel desperate toward our partner or pull back when things start to get serious. It can exaggerate feelings of jealousy or possessiveness or leave us feeling rejected and unworthy. Common critical inner voices we have toward ourselves about relationships include:

In this Webinar:  Having a healthy self-perception has been said to predict our health and well-being. Yet, staggering statistics continue to show our…

Once we have a better sense of where our insecurity comes from and the profound influence it is having on our lives, we can begin to challenge it. We can start by interrupting the critical inner voice process.Voice Therapyis a cognitive/affective/behavioral approach developed by Dr. Robert Firestone to help people overcome their critical inner voice. There are five important steps to this process, which I will briefly outline. To learn about Voice Therapy in more depthclick here.

Step I

The first step of Voice Therapy involves vocalizing your self-critical thoughts in the second person. You can also write down these thoughts. Instead of writing “I am so stupid. What is the matter with me? I’ll never be successful,” you would write, “You are so stupid. You will never be successful.” This process helps you to separate from these vicious attacks by seeing them as an external enemy instead of your real point of view. This process can also be an emotional one, as saying these statements can bring up underlying feelings from the past.

Step II

In the second step, you can start to think and talk about the insights and reactions you have to exposing these mean thoughts. Do they remind you of anyone or anything from your past? It can be helpful to uncover the relationship between these voice attacks and the early life experiences that helped shape them. This too will allow you to feel some self-compassion and reject these attitudes as accurate reflections of who you are.

Step III

People often struggle with the third step of this process, because it involves standing up to long-held beliefs and insecurities about oneself. You will answer back to your voice attacks, expressing your real point of view. You can write down rational and realistic statements about how you really are. Respond to your attacks the way you would to a friend who was saying these things about him or herself, with compassion and kindness.

Step IV

In step five of Voice Therapy, you start to make a connection between how the voice attacks are influencing your present-day behaviors. How do they affect you at work? With your partner? As a parent? In your personal ambitions? Do they undermine you? What events trigger the insecurity? In what areas is this insecurity most influential?

Step V

The final step involves making a plan to change these behaviors. If insecurity is keeping you from asking someone on a date or going after a promotion, it’s time to do the actions anyway. If you’re indulging in self-hating thoughts that encourage you to engage in self-destructive behaviors, it’s time to interrupt these behaviors and unleash the real you.

This process will not be easy. With change always comes anxiety. These defenses and critical inner voices have been with you your whole life, and they can feel uncomfortable to challenge. When you do change, expect the voices to get louder. Your insecurities aren’t likely to vanish overnight, but slowly, through perseverance, they will start to weaken. Whenever you notice an attack come up, stand up to it and don’t indulge in its directives. If you want to be healthy, don’t let it lure you to avoid exercise. If you want to get closer to your partner, don’t listen when it tells you to hold back your affections.

Join Dr. Lisa Firestone for a Webinar onOvercoming Insecurity

As you sweat through this tough but very worthy transition, it is important to practice self-compassion. Research by Dr. Kristin Neff found self-compassion to be far more psychologically beneficial than self-esteem. Self-esteem still focuses on evaluation and performance, where self-compassion encourages an attitude of kindness and patience. Self-esteem can increase our levels of insecurity, where self-compassion asks us to slow down and assign ourselves value simply for being human. Once we realize our own strength and importance, once we see the ways we’ve been hurt and can feel for ourselves on a deep level, we can actually start to break free of the chains that hold us back. We can shed the insecurities of our past and become the people we want to be.

Thank you.

Excellent!

I sometimes feel insecure and as much as i try i never seem to stop hearing those critical inner voices everyday theyre louder and louder and louder i try and try but it never works

I keep having this feeling that im a failure and all I do is fail .My Critical inner voices get louder everyday and every time I cant think straight and the sad part is that I have an interview in 2 weeks time and im so scared to pick up my books to even read incase it might be an examI get so scared that I always think im going to fail and disappoint everyone ,my mum ,my dad and my elder sister they’re all counting on me but i keep thinking that im hoping to fail and I dont know what to do 😞

You not a failure tell yourself that then go do it and see how it goes.

the inner voice you are hearing is not your voice. it’s the dark voice that is against your success. i advice you to read something like positive affirmation books, law of attraction books or even the bible. when the dark voice say you are a failure, say to that voice I am a successor, I am a winner, I will make, I am strong.

At times insecurity cripples me and my relationship. My (sometimes) success comes from deep within. Instead of reacting right away to the accelerant, take a breath and think…. think about the outcome if you say it. You will look weak,possessive self destructive,worthless etc… other people see it! PERIOD! Your not that good at hiding it! Let your feelings become disgusted toward your insecurities! When we are disgusted by something do we not back away, prevent or become sick?

Thank you, it’s good (in that way I need) to know that the exact same thoughts are expressed by someone else… this is my first time even googling help with my insecurities, I feel that there is an actual goal I may reach! I want it that bad! 🙂

Thank You to both of you. This has done damage to my relationship as well, and needed to know i’m not alone as well. The first reply couldn’t be more true of my past experiences, I thought I was hiding it, but it almost made it more prevelant. I need to tell myself to be angry at why i’m being insecure, and there is a much better person inside of me.

I am your friend.“All the brethren of the poor [uncertain or anxious about oneself] do hate him, how much more do his friends go far from him?He pursues them with words, yet they abandon him.” Proverbs: 19:7I was made a life long family scapegoat because of my mother’s failings. I seem to invite spitefulness everywhere, just by existing.

I was surely blessed with this piece… thanks for sharing and surely I have not remained the same. I am purposed to fight my insecurities…. keep positive and share with my other fellows struggling with the same. Thanks allot

This is by far the most informative article tagging everything that is presently looming in my life. This made my day and gives me hope for the change I so desperately seek.

I hope you’re doing okay now James its been 4 years already, how you holdin’ up?

I do need help with my marriage. I am insecure and I have been married a long time. I don’t get the attention I need and I do throw a fit in an angry way to deal with it. I stir up the fights and swear out loud. I feel I am in control when I do so. Also makes me feel better. Any advice is appreciated

Look up attachment theory, specifically anxious-avoidant relationships. I think that may help

Gosh. Every t I m e I am about to take that next step of committing to my present day crush..if we tell each other we like each other and decide we will be in a relationship ship.. I sense the passion immediately fading away. From fear? That they’re just going to use me or cheat and lie and leave me? From doubt? That it isn’t going to work out in the long haul there’s no way they’re the one or that its even worth investing time in something bound to fail. From social experience? Seeing other guys and girls in relationships flirt around and sleep around on their partners concludes that yes everyone must be doing it so my boyfriend is too!? I feel jealous or worried when a gorgeous girl is around him because I picture him being more attracted to her looks and style and flirty personality. Because in a small moment he is. It is the way human attraction works. But doesn’t necessarily mean im ugly and he doesn’t want me. That moment though drives me insane and I hate myself for not being the fittest or hottest so he doesn’t have to admire other women. Very very unrealistic but I try to hold myself to high standard and it only backfires.

I am insecure for sure. But because I am afraid of rejection and being left in the end. Which I make happen by putting so much focus and energy on the worry It fucks up trust, our communication line, happiness, romance and passion. Sex becomes a sad game of feeling used or more in control.

I just wanted to share that negativity because it’s real. It has taken over my lifeBut only when I am courting another. I am trying to brave myself into this new potential relationship but I already have ran my guy through the wire a hundred times assuming what he’s really doing and being paranoid accusing him of cheating and he probably will just end up doing so. Because I’m so unattractive like this.

My goal for today is to love my love the way I truly feel for him and smile at him and kiss him and appreciate him for sticking it through one more day. Not accuse or demand answers for conjured up in my head. I will be the beautiful soul I carry within and it will shine through my physical body. Confidence is key and I am accepting of my flaws and radiating my assets like they’re the the best thing since the invention of the internet lol

i just want to say, i can relate to you so much, you are not alone, but the way you are determined to love yourself and conquer your fears by shining your own light on your own worth is really inspiring. Thanks for your comment!

Thank you so much.

This article is helping me tremendously. Understanding why I am insecure, I can now focus on how to transition my ways of thinking. Thank you.

Nce article. Been going thru lots of negative thoughts. As of today l will try on being more accepting of myself. Want to be full of energy and feel great about being me.W

Thank you for effort in wanting to help others. And I truly hope there will be some relief for some because of your suggestions. My situation is so much more complex than being ridiculed by parents or significant others. I’ve come to realize, finally, in myearly sixties, that what I am experiencing was a path that was predestined before my birth. As in my souls Karmic cycle. Because of this learning curve, I have learned to accept that I will finish out this life with very few people with whom I can really relate to, and who genuinely care for me, as me. One of my favorite quotes: “Receive with simplicity, everything that happens to you.”Works for me.

This article has been a tremendous help. I struggle with a lot of self identity/image issues. Writing it out, and facing these things was terribly emotional, but absolutely needed. Just doing those things was a huge step for me. Over the years I’ve become complacent with my insecurities, and have done little, if anything, to change them.

After reading, and going though my own steps, I feel like the “bed for change” has been made.

Thank you, again.

I will try this method out I’ve been struggling with my insecurities really my whole life a lot of the article is why I’ve struggled with insecurities. Growing up with a lot of mental abuse and loneliness i am only 20 years old I just turned 20 I wish sometimes I had someone to talk to like a therapist but it’s 2019 and I barely got money for the things I need on a daily bases as much I feel like need to talk to someone I can’t afford it. I am a true believer in the lord I pray and talk to God pretty often I cry a lot too. I’m still at a stage in life where I’m trying to get on my feet and figure things out. I don’t talk to many people about my personal thoughts me personally I think I’m crazy or bout lost it , and I honestly don’t have friends and the ones I do have wouldn’t understand . Any who i will take baby steps at trying this and just continue to pray but my life right now is really depressing and it gets to me at times it really does. Sometimes I still feel like I don’t wanna be here.

I pray to God as well; and I know he answers my prayers, and that he will answer yours too.

I’m 32 years old, a solo parent and a struggling student. Been trying my whole life to improve myself but nothing seems to work.

I’ll be praying for you too,I may not know you,But believe me I understand what your going through, cus I’m going through the same thingJust know, you are loved ♥.This article was so helpful. Thank you

I know exactly how you feel. I’m the same age as you and I’ve learnt that it’s not what you pray about, or that you pray at all, but how you pray. If you pray about your insecurities, it’s that voice coming out again, and that could spiral into negative thoughts. So I pray about what I’ve done socially, with work, relationships etc. Thinking positively and that knowing you are a deep thinker can make you feel far more worthy than you think. Also, surround yourself with clubs and community as much as possible, but only in an area you can manage. Even talking to one person is better than a whole group as you can really delve deep into a conversation and assure that your thoughts are normal to many many people :))

I find this so helpful ,I’ve been going through at it over and over again, now I see some positive changes in my life. Thank You

Indeed.

to be honest people are mostly insecure about their apperance/shape of their body..for example: someone will be stressed that they’re fatand their will be someone who is in good shape, but still insecure..

Im insecure about my body.

That is hard, being insecure about your body. Thank you for sharing that, and just know that you are not alone, and you have strength.

I am as well and I am not that old so it makes me nervous how I could change for the better

I find this super helpful, I always find that i am not good enough or that I am extremely different then everyone else, I also feel like I don’t always belong ): but this article has taught me some really amazing techniques (:

Very helpful! I found many of these critical thoughts play out in my head everyday. While I am very confident in certain areas, other areas are full of self doubt. I am going to ask my therapist to work with me on the Voice Therapy.

so i am not the only one who is insecure. 🙂 we can do this guys!

Thank you, big help at time of great insecurity ?

Recent events in my life have triggered my insecurities to the point where I have pushed my other half away and have pretty much gotten the feeling I lost her. Not only do I feel I’ve lost her but my family in general. This article has shown me things to help me counter these insecurities and I pray that I can get my family back and be happy once again.Thanks for writing this amazing article

I too had pushed my family away and now am closer to them. Hope it all went well for you too.

I am going through this as we speak ..ive been dating an amazing woman for two years we got 4 beautiful kids together ..but due to my past and probably cause my parents split when i was 18 i spent the first 2 years treating her like shit .even though deep down inside my core she was the one i always wanted ..we had a falling out a few months back ..where from all the fighting we did i thought i couldnt handle it..when it was meerly me loosing my cool and not communicating..but i left to go live with a buddy..and that night i left ..i ..i realized how badly and how much in love i was with her..so we got back together ..unfortionatly i did not learn from my mistakes of lashing out during a simple fight ..and we ended up splitting for about 3 weeks..but during those 3 weeks ..i was miserable constantly blaiming myself and constantly thinking she is gonna be with a better man..constantly overthinking and analyzing shit.. to make a long story short..we are together now tryna work through it..and im thankful..but during those 3 weeks i awoken bad mind overthinking habits ive had since 18..and now the insecurities wont go away..im either overthinking shes gonna find another man..or she doesnt love me..or this will end..but when she shows me an ounce of security ..my mind goes to the overthinking process and questioning of is this the woman i wanna be with ..do i love her..just super negativity out of nowhere..and now i cant help but wake up and go to bed thinking about the bullshit that plagues me..i want to be happy with myself like i was just last month and also be with the woman i know i love at my core ..but the thoughts hold me back significantly .and i am not myself at all..

Hold on to how much she loves you…..hold on to what an amazing mom she is to your kids ……hold on and remember how she’s always will to make it work between the both of you…….but in the mean while fight….fight…fight….that feeling of insecurity…….don’t let it take away this beautiful life you’ve made……fight it like how you would protect your kids from danger or harm…… take care

I am in the same situation I am insecure and have 2 little boys and I am being to clingy and needy and now my lady is saying she needs space and I am finding it hard to give it to her.

I’m in the same situation

Recently i have been thinking about starting a podcast to talk about insecurity, and interview people to talk about their own. I want to create a community, where people can feel safe to express their own insecurity, so that they can start taking action and overcome it. Also to show that there are many out there on the same boat. However, the ironic thing is that my own insecurity is holding me back, the thought that i would be able to reach no one, and fail is in my way.

I have been looking for this. I wish I had found this sooner. Here’s to a better and improved me!!!

Thank you!

Thank you. You said it all so well

Thanks for this article. Feeling really bad today. It gives me some hope.

is insecurity heriditary? because my paternal grand dad is insecure so is my dad, and i am beginning to be so too

I’m not sure it’s hereditary but many of the underlying causes this article mentions tend to be passed down from parent to child. Personally I think it’s more about circumstances than genetics but everything can have an effect to a degree. After reading this article I hope to focus on improving my own insecurities so that I do better for my children.

Thank you. What great insight.

Thank you for this information it has really helped me to think clearly about what I say about myself.

i want to do this so badly but i don’t think i have the strength to do it nor energy, i’m 6 months pregnant as well so this could be a factor in my insecurity, my insecurity gets in the way everyday with me and my partner but it seemed like my insecurities got stronger when with him. i’m thinking that maybe it’s because this is my first actual relationship that i love and i don’t want to lose it so i’m scared that something is going to take him away from me, i’m tempted every day to put makeup on and do my hair and wear pretty clothing because i feel like someone better will come along and take him and sees me struggle with my insecurities, he knows it hurts me and he tells me everyday that he loves me and tells me that i’m beautiful and i believe it sometimes but sometimes i don’t. he holds me when i can’t cope with my overwhelming thoughts.

I hear you on that. I am planning to tell my fiance tonight. I struggle with anxiety as well and it is killing me. When I got engaged, I experienced so much anxiety but we were living in different cities so I was able to pull myself together before we Skyped. Now were in the same place and between the anxiety and the insecurity I don’t know which is worse. One seems to trigger the next. I pick arguments with him without even knowing why. It’s tearing us apart and this in turn causes more anxiety, more insecurity. I’m a mess.

I can totally relate. I keep pushing my partner away. I need to get some help.

Hope you can get better with your struggle. I feel so much like you.

life has been a struggle.. BT thanks for the insight I really needed it.

Thank you for this article.

This is a very well constructed article, but I feel it caters to the general populace too much, I mean of course that’s what you want in an article that’s going to be posted on the Internet. But there was a reason I typed this in and read the whole article. I feel like there are many points I can take away from this as anyone could, but the insecure part of me that is unique to myself feels that this is all wrong and doesn’t apply to many many aspects of my own personal insecurity. I personally enjoy being insecure looking from 3rd party perfect ice as I feel it makes me unique, but isn’t that just a form of insecurity itself ? I’m happy with who I am and what people think of me, I’m just not happy with what I think of me. This won’t help people like me and I can’t find anything that can, I don’t even know if I’m looking for help… I’m just trying to understand because it’s interesting.

I am a 18 yr old guy currently in my second semester ,I am quite average looking, I used to feel insecure about how I look since I was a kid and I took those feelings with me till today, and here I am in college I still have thoughts of what people think about me even when they don’t know me , I read many articles regarding this and Today I will start overcoming this feeling that drags me down ,I also turn the bad thoughts intoPower to aid myself and others ,I’ve always been training im the gym and this is definetely gives an extra source of power so people , you must face your insecurities to be able to get rid of them , its a slow process and it depends on how you feel inside , anyway thanks for this and I hope I helped

Hi, I loved hearing all the responses to this article and can relate to the person on the other end of the spectrum.. I Have been in a relationship which is currently at its end of 5+ yrs. I have dealt with this insecure man in ever way this article describes. First I would like to say that he is currently sober and has been for 23 years. I. Am Very proud of his achievement. On the other hand I have experienced his behavior of insecurity control impulsiveness adbandment, obsession , and jealousy. I could prob right a book on our past 5 years. Being in this rollercoaster of a relationship has made me not trust a man. It’s very hard when , especially the insecure person is in denial. It’s a constant battle everyday. He stars fight and takes tantrums when he doesn’t get his way. His mother left him and the family at such a young that he started drinking at 13 to self medicate his mother abandmant. They still till this day rarely talk she is very distant from her adult kids. This has effected him more than he can ever understand. I have read article after article been to AA meetings al alonon and therapy becuz of this torture I allowed , I allowed this to go on more than I should have, but love is blind. And I have been brot to taking more medication than I was described so I could show him how much it was killing me. I wanted him to see the damage he was doing. His first wife killed herself from Depressin and Being cheated on by this man for years he was unable t stop his addictions. He stopped drinking for 23 but didn’t fix the things that originally brot him there to begin with. All those surpressed feelings of adbandment came to the surface and made this man a living hell for me to be with. I always wondered y one minute we were so happy and the next he was out of control jealous obsessive and a control freak. He had such stinky thinking that took over his brain, which I don’t think he will ever understand. He used t claim I was places when. I Wasn’t and wanted to know my whereabouts at all times it was so suffocateing and dibilitaing. He eventually cheated on me and claimed I was doing it to him , but God as my witness I never did and couldn’t u figure out y he always accused me of it, but finally it made sense he put ha own insecurities on me to relieve his own guilt of what he was doing to me. He can’t maintain a relationship becuz he always thinks of it ended and ends it before he can get hurt but always has a back up to protect his potential loniness. I wish he would get the help he needs to help not only himself but his own kids who are experiencing these same issues with him, he buys there love rather than show them affection. He prushes them off tlike they are crumbs on a table. I lived with him off and on for 3 yrs, and dealt with being verbally abused and bullied constantly and him assumptions and projective behavior!!! it has made me scared to date again. Especially the cheating part. I am a very confident independent women and I feel that I will soon be able to find the right man and I will not tolerate any behavior that is even close to a insecure man. Also I was married to an alcoholic for 23 yrs. and feel that was not as bad as dealing with a sober insecure man. Just my point of view . Thanks for reading.

Thank you. I’ve been able to help myself understand the irrational self-doubt I have had looming over me with the help of this article.

Thank you very much. I’ve been trying to change but I had no idea how and this article helped me. Besides, after reading all this comments I realized that I’m not alone in this fight and I will overcome all theses feelingsMy father was and still is very critic to me. Everybody that is not like him , he considers weak and useless because he considers that anyone have the same capacity of him. It is hard fot me not cry everyday and ignore his critics but I will.

I really appreciate this post! It actually gives practical steps which is helpful 🙂

Good piece of research and writing indeed. I am hoping I will be free from these chains too, if it has happened to others why would it not to me! thank you

Thank you SO much. For the longest time I have been constantly bothered by the thought that I a not pretty, that he could never love me and nobody every would. I have been bothered by the thoughts of put-downs that are so crazy it would seem unreal. But because of this article, the thoughts have faded into the background. I could never thank you more!!!

For the longest time I just assumed i was different, and i let my insecurities destroy numerous relationships in my life. As I was reading this article, i couldn’t help but crack a smile as I realized I’m not alone. The article plus the amazing comments gave me a sense of relief that i could overcome this and would not let it define me any longer. We are all human beings and we are all amazing, and I finally feel like I’m a human being now too, so thank you very very much. I truly appreciate this!

It have been an amazing and nourishing article but like you said most critical inner voices are build up from bad past experiences….so what if i have something holding me down that i dont even know if is a problem but i keep thinking its a big deal….

This helps me understand why I’m so insecure because I’ve had so many people talk down to me… And how my parents’ marige is going is not helping at all…

Thank you all ..it was so helpful to know I am not alone who struggle with it.

I stopped in the middle of therapy. I found out, I (thought I) hated myself. So I would work very hard to please anyone in my realm so I could get self worth. Found out step parents really painted ugly pictures in my head. Then, done. Lost my job, no insurance, and I was left mildly informed, scared, and alone.

This article is wonderful. It will help me as i transition my life back to voluntary mental health therapy. I will read it everyday, as my symptoms are quite severe. I can already feel the chains breaking. The fruit from my worthy tree is starting to ripe. Light is at the end of the tunnel and all I have to do is remember the kind words in this article.

On the outside, we are handsome or pretty, smart, funny, loving… This article already covered the inside. Time to put the lies to rest, and set the truth free!

We are all humans, and therefore are entitled to all that entails. Self security. 🙂

This comment helped me so much. Thank you for sharing. I hope you are doing well.

Yes, what a beautiful comment! We are all worthy of love.

Thank you, so much!!I have battled with self hatred & such a high level of insecurity , I have hurt a lot of people & I have been a victim also. Pam I thank you for your openness & courage for sharing the way you did.I hope & pray everyone finds freedom , strength & success & the husbands & wives who support you & bring out the best in you all.I had a terrible abusive childhood & growing up was , abusive myself but I tried so hard to not be like the previous generations before me but as lifes tragedies unfolded I became my greatest fear , I felt like I was in a mental & emotional prison with no way out & no way I could hold down any relationship.Pam I hate to admit it but I have been that same person as your partner , but I seen many counsellors & Psychologists & became a Christian but yet , at times been like Oliver when I just cannot love myself & have a HEALTHY view of who I am …I know there is a part of me that is so loving & caring & wants to help others , but as soon as I enter into a relationship I am overcome with FEAR & insecurity ..I am truly grateful for this post , I never stopped seeking helpI hope & pray this is the tool to set me free to love & support everyone in my life without restraint 🙂 God bless us all

Insecurities were waying me down everyday of my life and it got me feeling that they was no way to success but now they is no insecurity can way me down coz I would deffinetly deal with it thanks alot

Thank you tons! I finally feel like I could take a stand for myself.

This is amazing advice!

Thank you.

thanx…sir…

sir i m definatly try this

Super insecure guy here and I’ll say while this article helps, I don’t see how to get past my insecurities because of my situation. The article stated, “What they found is that the most common self-critical thought people have toward themselves is that they are different – not in a positive sense, but in some negative, alienating way.” I definitely struggle with this and the reason I think the self critical thoughts are true is that out of all my relatives families, (I have 4 uncles and 5 aunts) every one of them and all my cousins are successful in life. Successful being defined as gainfully employed and have the income to have children. Except my Dad and Mom. I think my Mom projects her insecurities on my Dad but with just reason because he is lazy and hasn’t asserted himself in life. It causes his insecurities to be even worse where I don’t think he even wants to try at anything. Including being a presently active father to me. It’s painful for me to think or accept that my Dad is a loser. Of course despite that I love my Dad and try to focus on the positive aspects he has. However what makes this more difficult is that I also gave up trying because of my insecurities and deep down judge myself as a loser. Knowing that my relatives probably look down on him, my Mom, and even myself and my sister, fills me not only with self pity but also resentment towards my relatives, my parents and myself. I try not to see my relatives and some have never made an effort to be close to them. I am content to live my own life away from it all and try to surround myself with people who are supportive. However I still have to see them occasionally at major events like the wedding I am currently attending. These insecurities have been crippling to the point where it is hindering me from achieving my goals. Cannabis and Netflix have provided some relief but I believe distractions like that only mask the issues and doesn’t help me overcome them. I sometimes want to leave society behind and run into the wild like that guy who died in that abandoned bus in the woods although I do not wish the same fate. If anyone has any advice it would be appreciated. Thx

Hello Jack.I My conditions if not the same is very close to yours as of the relatives. I had a wonderful childhood. It was materialistic . i may have had every toy that i may have wished for But my parents were never there for my emotonal needs and even caressing counts. And now my mom is going through somewhat they call Mid-life Crisis and that sometimes makes her lash out on me or my dad. And i am not blaming her for this in a way she has her own reasons. A few years back it was really bad for me casue my mom and dad really used to fight a lot and being a single child i had no one to share it with. Looking at my mom i became more and more insecure about my feelings without even really talking about it with anyone. Now what i have realized is that the less you think about this stuff the better you can focus on something that make you fee happy and helps you raise your self-esteem. I did that with studies and i am not that good in academics i was like a 60 % aggregate student. and now i am the class topper. I would just say that look at your condition not like a way to blame for your insecurities but as a challenge. GOD Or UNIVERSE (whatever you believe in) has given you this wonderful opportunity to prove something and believe me 24 hours a day is not short at all.. It is a perfect design. It is made that way so we could exploit it. Just work hard like make a plan.. and if you are like me you might get overwhelmed to read all this and act on it. But it’s really not that difficult. You just have to start.. There will be many times when you would be like “Okay that is enough for today ” or ” maybe i will start that tomorrow” but remember whenever these kind of thoughts come to mind just remember to start.. It will be so much fun that you would hardly think that you cant do it.. No matter how difficult it is. I think if I can do it Anybody can. JUst start .. that simple

Hello jack. Your history is almost the same than mine. My mother very insecure and my father very lazy and not a responsible father and taking my mothers money. now I am overcoming this mental illness. I forget the past, because already past. Greets from Honduras.

This article has helped me to see what and why I am unsuccessful in relationships thank you so much for allowing me to see the demons I must overcome and am going to stand up to , it’s time for me to live and for others to see the real me without the voices, I grew up being sexually abused and put down and nothing being good enough but it’s time to break this chain

This is so helpful, Thank you.

i have an insecurity with my legs. I am a dancer, and is doing basic ballet. But my legs arent proportioned with my upper body. It felt like my legs are too short to even do a proper split and plie. And whenver i stretch them, i feel very inferior. My insecurity affected my passion to dance to the point i thought that i was never meant to be a dancer because of my body proportion.

Now, im following these steps and will try to overcome it slowly. This very helpful and has lighten me up and gave me hope. I am depressed and anxious just because of this insecurity. Thank you so much

Thank you so much.

before coming here , i had sort of panic attack of insecurities.. so all i could to was to spill it out in my phones memory keeping thing. i was surprised to see what i wrote was already written here …I just hope these echos could go away and let me appreciate what i already have.

I plan to read and re-read this page over and over again because it contains some very valuable information – things that can change lives. Thank you for publishing it!

Thanks. This is coming to me at the right time. In fact, I feel like not leaving here so as to be reading it to myself even in my dream. I still need serious help as my past broken relationships has increased the insecurity in me. Thanks a lot for the information

I am insecure in every way , this is really helpful thank you.

I’m so glad I found and read this article thank you !!!

Thank you ,but please how do I asses my improvement

Thank you for this great article

I am a 53 years old divorced and now living with my partner of 4 years, she is amazing, funny, confident, independent and a million other things besides. I am so lucky to have found love a second time and have so much to look forward to including ambitions to build our own house ?. I have my own small business and my partner is a manager. It all sounds perfect but there is a but!!! I am massively insecure, Looking back I felt so safe in my marriage three lovely children a nice house and friends but think I have always been a little bit needy nut I don’t remember it ever being enough to cause any real issues or even be mentioned. I have been to counselling, read articles on line, books and blogs galore which have helped but not cured. I can go for months using positive thoughts to keep it in check then all of a sudden the most stupid of things will set of a spike it’s like a firework going off and nothing will put it out, I try hiding it but my partner can see through it and says its so obvious that I’m quiet or in a mood, I try to deny it because I know what ever I’m thinking is socially not acceptable and in the cold light of day down right rediculous too, I hate lies and lying with a passion my ex cheated and the lies that go with it are devastating from someone you trusted as your closed friend for nearly 30 years! Any way if I’m asked what’s wrong I can’t help it but it comes out and then all hell breaks out, I critise her and say it’s her fault, only when it’s all calmed down I realise it’s my irrational thoughts and she done nothing wrong so to cut an all ready long story short I’m pushing her away and leaving so many scares, she doesn’t deserve this no one does. I feel so guilty and think I’m such a bad person. I have just read the above article which has given me some real food for thought, I can’t recal where in my childhood insecurity has come from though. I so want to be cured! It’s so painful worse than any physical trauma

So, like everyone else here I suffer from insecurities that are affecting my new relationship. I met her and fell head over heals in love on our first date. It was so perfect I felt God had brought us together. When we first started out, she was the more insecure and told me so. So afraid to lose me every day and then something happened; the roles were reversed and I became or my insecurities came out in full force! Now we are engaged but I’m still insecure. She posted on FB about her new man,(me) and how fabulous he was and how happy she is. Then all of a sudden every trace of me is gone from her page except that she is engaged to me. She says it’s because people that post relationships on Facebook typically end up broken up. I don’t where this is coming from but three weeks after we started dating she disclosed that her cancer came out of remission and she was dealing with that. Also she is a single mom and getting no support she runs herself into the ground to support her kids. Her kids call me dad and love me but in the back of my mind is something going on here? It’s like being on a roller coaster where one day she is all lovey dovey and planning our move together and two days later she is run down and our conversations are polite and uninvolved. She tells me she loves me and misses me every day ( 3 hours apart) and can’t wait till we are married and living our lives together. The next day or so, nothing. We text all day but it feels strained sometimes and I don’t know if it’s from my insecurities or if this relationship of two months is going bad as fast as it came on. I would walk on fire for her and don’t want to give up but am so spun I don’t know if I’m coming or going!!!

Hi Mike,In my experience nobody is in the same mood everyday! Some days happy and full of love, the next tired stressed and not as high on love! Once the honey moon period starts to fade and reality of life takes over ie:- work, children, money problems and health all kick in, this can allow insecurities to creep in! After all who would feel insecure when you text each other all the time, have sex three times a day and tell each other you love be them all the time? From experience and reading various books and blogs I found one partner will generally start to back off / want a little more relaxed pace before the other. It’s easy for me now to see what’s happening when I read others struggling,but when it happened to me it was so confusing I didn’t know if I was coming and going!!! Ok so things that helped me – a counsellor once told me Buddhas believe ” everything passes” I took that to mean if I’m feeling the insecure keep busy don’t dwell on it and the feeling will pass, feed it and it will get stronger!!. I know it’s possible to speed the process up by asking our partner to tell us they love us and how much but that only makes us more reliant on others rather than self sufficient! ( I know it’s very very hard but it made me stronger) when we text our partner are we texting to get a response ( to satisfy our insecurity) or because we want them to know how much we care or want them? Looking at what you put about texting if it seems forced it probably is and in my experience it’s a normal relaxing of the relationship, I refer you to what I put above. Life is way to short to worry take each day at a time enjoy every minute. Hope this helps?

Mike, I agree with Paul. Pretty much everything.Just don’t forget, life is a struggle, and anyone pretending it isn’t is fooling themselves.We have to stay positive, wake up and choose joy, but some days are better than others. You are a new couple, so texting all day (not every day) is going to happen. That will probably fade, unless you really like being on your phone all day (I do not).

Take each day, one at a time. some days you will both feel like communicating a lot, other days will be more quiet. Try to learn to go with the flow of your, and her emotional state, that day. If you think something is bothering her, maybe ask her, but tell her she doesnt have to talk about it if she needs time. Life is a roller coaster for everyone. If you keep putting love first, and sounds like that is exactly what you are doing, you are on the right path. Don’t question it. Follow your heart, and be tough.Good luck

this article helped me to realize my insecurities

I have been suffering from this insecurity I don’t know that this mess is caused by the voices in my head thanks to this bloc i m going to work on the voices in my head.

I can realate to most of you and it’s not an easy thing to live with. My story started when I was a kid, from being teased to being told your ugly by your own grandmother and went into my teen years of bad realationships to being married to an abusive man. Yes I did leave after living in fear of my and myself after 20 yrs and today I am now married to the most amazing man , I’m happy but my insecurities from my past life are causing me to think that I’m not good enough or pretty enough and yes like you I worry someone better for him will take the one thing that completes me. I find myself questioning him about girls he’s friends with on fb and when he’s texting I’m assuming it’s with a girl. I hate this and I want it to stop!!!! I don’t like who I am, he can’t even play out ( he’s a guitar player ) without looking around the room like a vulture seeing whom I’m up against! It’s sad I know and I’m sure I look stupid but I can’t help it and I do try but fall back into the insecure net ugh!!!!Sincerelywomen who lovers her hubby

Hey PaulineI found it just as hard as you to get used to my partner getting random txt and worrying where the next threat would come from. The light bulb moment for me was flipping it around to thinking any amount of people can threaten, but my partner has chosen me and as long as I choose to be the best person I can then hey if we do split up I have done everything I could with no regrets, no wishing I had done things differently.Live every day to be the best person you can!

I thought I was the only one out here, and everyone else had life worked out ?

Amazing read, almost like a DIY but the important thing for me and for others, is to use it everyday and not for the sake of instant results.

I’ve found this helpful thanks. Some people are good at being a manager, it’s all about relaxing no matter what they don’t know you girl and as long as your trying to improve no matter what you’ve been through things will change never let anything bring you down 😀 don’t be scared just try hard and soar among the queers no one is better than the other in this world that’s a healthy attitude in it’s self everyone is special and have a purpose find your talent and if there is something about you to cause insecurities that can be a positive thang, never quit.

I’m only 16 but I’ve fought a lot of those listed above, and had grown complacent with them, but after reading this article it has given me encouragement and advice on how to conquer my insecurity. This is really helpful. Thanks so much.

I’m so glad I found this article. I want to stop feeling so damm insecure all the time. I want to “unleash” my true self. Thank you. ??

I loved the talk on self-compassion and the critical inner voice! The information contained in this article was exactly what I needed to read. Thank you so so so much!

Thank you for making this article. I was bullied by people which caused me to look at myself differently and I used to not care about what I looked like, but I started looking at myself in the mirror everyday and hating what I saw. I also became obsessed with eating less food and torturing myself just so I could lose a pound or two and feel better about myself, but it never made me truly feel good about myself. Fortunately, I had friends who helped me through it all and thanks to this article my life is slowly being picked up from the ground and being put back together like a broken puzzle. Thank you so so much for publishing this and God bless you all. <3

Thank you for this article! I now understand where insecurity starts..in the home. I had wonderful loving parents but always felt scared and alone…my father was an alcoholic and I had an emotionally abusive brother. My Mom worked full time trying to keep the family afloatShe struggled with depression and anxiety. I felt invisible. I would stay in my room most of the time. I was very shy and introverted. So, this carried over into my adult years. I have always been labled as weak and fragile8 hate that. Although I am now in my 50’s and have a few close relationships and a fairly successful career, my insecurities get the best of me almost daily. I hope this will help to change my way of thinking. For anyone else out there who is suffering, I think it is time we put an end to thi! God put us on this earth to be happy and to be good to others and ourselves! Peace and Love!!

Everything written above here is exactly what happening to me now and before. I will follow the steps and positively wait for the results. Amen!

I am 29, Latino and good looking man. But I never had a girlfriend, resings many jobs. Loosing pretties women. I have been dealing with insecurity all my life. Now I feel 80% healed I am very happy , I started to change at my 21 .has been a very slow process. My mom was insecure all her life and then transfer it to me.

I think my insecurity began when I was in elementary school. Now at 22, they seem to haunt my life completely. I’ve never felt good enough. It first started with my grades, my parents expected nothing but A’s. I remember when I made a B in the fifth grade— I burst into tears in the class room. (However it turned out the teacher made a mistake of my grade sheet). I’ve never felt good enough, always trying to please someone. I remember always comparing my body, i was never pretty enough or skinny enough. Even now I feel the same way. The matter is, I’ve never fully addressed my body dysmorphia. I’ve just tried to correct it. I would obsess over other women’s bodies. I’d diet, it wouldn’t eat. I’d also go through moments when I wouldn’t care and eat anything. The thing is— I’ve always been labeled as “skinny.” I’ve 5’10’’ about 145 pounds. For some reason I feel the need to be perfect. I need the perfect body, perfect grades, face, lifestyle. I spend hours at night reorganizing and color coding my clothes. But I’ve never seemed to get them perfect. When I was in middle school and throughout high school, I would redecorate my room, shifting furniture and painting for hours. There were many nights I just didn’t sleep. Many nights I just gave up because I couldn’t achieve perfect. Hahaha all of these tendencies stroll exist, but I act them out in lesser degrees. I still reorganize my closet every two months. Some months I still workout obsessively. My mind’s still searching for a recipe for perfection. I do understand my concepts about life are completely unattainable. Perfection doesn’t exist. I just want to be happy in my skin, and in my life… preferably before I’m 23.

I couldn’t even read this article, couldn’t get passed the examples like ‘you’re stupid,’ what a trigger.

I find this article very interesting but struggle with the 5-step example you outlined. I find it difficult to look at this “innner voice” as you call it as simply a voice because somehow it feels like the voice controls me so much as it were that all my bad thoughts have literally become a reality. It’s not just a feeling or thought but more something that describes me I feel.

But other than that I did like the article and it looks like it has some real truth to it. Sadly I’m not sure how to incorperate the message into my life for reason stated above…

This is sooo close to the Subconscious Imprinting Technique that we promote.Addressing the feelings/voices and recognizing them, even thinking about where they came from in the past, this is awesome!The only part I would add to this, is finding EXACTLY when, where, who trapped that emotion in your body (using muscle testing) … then releasing it.

Awesome stuff! 🙂

This article is amazing! It includes almost all the possible roots of bad feelings. It helped me a lot! ? I had really bad childhood. Today, from this valuable article, I understood that I should start to feel compassionate towards myself. It is so soothing to know I’m not the only one who had a lot of painful experiences in childhood.

This explanation was very helpful. I especially like the “voices will get louder” when you start to confront your inner critic. I can tell that’s when it gets to be the hardest and the author wrote this so well. Thank you.

Very informative & helpful but what can one do when the two most important people in your life are the ones making you feel insecure & they don’t even know it. & you know they’re not doing it on purpose, they love you, they would never want to hurt you but your brain just takes over & makes you feel so tiny.

I understand exactly what you are going through, i am in the same situation, also my partner is in the same situation too. In my case, throughout my adolescent and teen life, and even now in my 20s, my asian ass parents would constantly be reminding me that if you dont go school and get good grades, you will never make money and become successful. So i thought that to be true, however, i sucked ass at school, grades were okay, but nothing spectacular. what made it worse was that my brother didn’t go to uni, so their expectation of me got even larger. And again, i suck at uni, i hated, my GPA is struggling at 2.0, this made me questioned myself, how are other people so smart, why can’t i be the same, i probably wont be successful (otherwise don’t have a trajectory of going anywhere in life). Only recently have i decided to live my own life, and do what i want, however, that glimpse of insecurity is still there, making me doubtful whether i am actually good enough to do things. And even till now, my parents always seem to be on my ass, when i don’t go to work (i am able to work from home if i wanted to) they would always ask me why am i not at work today, with an underlying implication that they think i am not doing well. which bugs me, i try to not let it get to me but it still does. However, i try not to blame them, im trying to step into their shoes to understand why they are that way. They simply came over to australia for their kids to have a better life, no english, no prospect, they didnt believe in themselves to amount to anything big. Therefore, they slaved away at physical labour, trying to put their kids through school, their insecurities stem from the love for their kids, they don’t want us to go through what they went through. This is just one of my insecurities, however, that is the light that i am trying to shine on it. i want to take accountability for myself, i choose whether i let those insecurities cripple me from moving forward, or whether i tell it to fuck off, even though i would still be feeling it while moving forward. In saying that, daily, i still find myself procrastinating 80% of the time, either due to the fact that i don’t find fascination in my job, or it is because my insecurity is stopping me from trying hard so that i don’t risk failing. That is for me to figure out, and something that i will overcome.

Reading many of this story, it has really touched me deeply, i really want to create an outlet for the scale, so that people can openly voice their insecurities and begin to overcome the hardships that it brings along. I’ve been thinking of starting a podcast talking about insecurities, interview anyone who is willing to share their experience. So that a community can be created to help people shine a light on their insecurity themselves, and begin to take action on their own happiness and fulfillment. I am definitely not an expert, i do not want to give advice, i just want to show people that there are also people out there who are also suffering, and that no one has their shit figured out. And most importantly, i want to help lift my partner up, she suffer from major insecurities due to her parents who are mentally abusive towards her, which i have been observing, the cause of her lack of self-confidence.

I pushed someone who truly loved me away, just because I just could not believe he loved me. It’s like every time he would show affection, I would fear if I showed him that I cared I will screw up, so held back several times. And eventually he thought I was not interested in him and he left.

I’ve recently got back together with my baby daddy after 7 years of being apart. But was thinking of ending it again coz I feel unworthy of him. I’ve always had insecurities about everything in my life. Not successful in my chosen career, not confident of my abilities, not sure any man can love me long term, don’t know how to mother my 9 year old girl without destroying her real self(hv tendency to over praise & treat her like she’s 5). This article is an eye opener as it teaches me how to be self compassionate, concurrently changing the way I relate & treat everyone

Thank you so much for this very useful article.

I need help controlling my insecurities my jealousy

I needed this very badly. Been holding up my insecurities so long that people can easily let me down.

Firstly, I will a big thank you for this words of encouragement. While growing up, discovering the things I love, have always been told that I cannot do better. That am a failure. Am 23, but I still hear this inner voice telling me I cannot have someone who will love me. Because of this insecurities, I don’t have friends, I always want to be alone. Believing I cannot be loved. But after reading this, I believe I can overcome all my fears and insecurities. I want to love my self first and love everyone around. And heal from my past.Thanks

Im 24 and I still can remember how kids told me that I was ugly. I was at a kindergarden with my brother. They pull him away from me and told him not to get near to me. I felt so isolated and hating myself. I even got bullied. This year I fought with my sister, and she yell to me “you don’t even realize that you are ugly!”. Damn, it hurts me so much. After a long year I built myself up, those words brings me down. Well nobody tell me that I’m beautiful, so maybe thats how is it. I know that nobody defines me, but it’s so hard to say that I’m also worthy when nobody appreciates me. But I have to appreciate myself for who I am. I’ll be more compassionate to myself.

Sara i am so sorry to hear you have been treated this way. People can be cruel and dont think, and alot of times do not even mean what they say. It seems to me from reading your words that you have a beautiful heart and mind and that is what really makes a person beautiful. If you just keep learning to love and accept yourself more, exactly as you are, perfectly You, with flaws and all, then you can appreciate yourself which opens the door for someone else to also appreciate you.

Till i read this article, i didn’t know what i going through or my problem is insecurity.. i thought i was shy, socially awkward, shamefull.. just a one who takes the blame all on himself… But tgat was all the effect of my insecurity..

My mother used to curse me alot and my father used to insalt me very heartfeeling words.. i mean the type of insult that u would throw at your meaneat enemy.. Actually he also have insecurities at some point and he was angry at life.. and people there at work, would tease him for his insecurities.. Then he will come back home and load all these things on us.. he uses every word on us that has broke his heart.. He can’t speak for himself… And and he came home and insult us.. Matterfact I’m the older one and he puts alot of tones of demoralization on me.. He used to insult me like I’m retarded and different.. I would go and ask my friends if I’m that guy.. ant they would say , that I’m not. And then i become introvert, shy and all the negative things

But thank God i got some good friends and they helped me to feel normal.. I mean no one understand these things unless u go through it. For many years i hated my father and used to have no care for my mom. I thought it is because what they said was right.. i though it was because i was abnormally different.

Okay.. let me rap this up.. i wanna thank u for letting me know what my problem is.. and fo showing how to solve this.. you saved my life

Oh thanks so much for this, at some point I hated my self….You have just saved my relationship

I have had my own fair or should I say unfair share of jealousy, attachment, marital conflicts as a result of my own insecurity.It took the concerted effort of great friends, amiable husband, family, and great books like the one written by Amy Christine, Overcome Insecurity and Fear in your Relationships. These books helped me to put things in perspective.

I was having a moment of insecurity and decided to find help online, see how other people cope with it. This article helped me. I also suggest people read the book written by Amy Christine titled Overcome Insecurity and Fear in your Relationship. Here the link below where you can find details about this.https://yourloverelationships.wordpress.com/2020/05/24/insecurerelationship/

I’m 18 and I’m always insecure about how I look. I wear eye glasses and I look good in them but I feel very vulnerable without them. I have eye bags that don’t go away…. people tell me I’m fine and all but it’s just hard.

In my own experience, conflicts arise out of each person trying to fulfill what they believe to be their needs. In many cases, the ones that don’t get resolved and cause scars on a relationship is when those needs are rooted in fear. I think the author’s advice on patience and allowing each other to go into a neutral corner for a timeout to process their emotions is important. I really like the Amy Christine method (https://yourloverelationships.wordpress.com/2020/05/24/insecurerelationship/) and I have found that whenever I feel resentment, using Christine has allowed me to trace it back to my own fears. Naming those fears and sharing them with your partner can melt the resentment and soften your heart so that you can truly have compassion for the other person. I don’t know who said it, but I really do believe that love is the absence of fear.

I keep having this feeling that im a failure and all I do is fail .My Critical inner voices get louder everyday and every time I cant think straight and the sad part is that I have an interview in 2 weeks time and im so scared to pick up my books to even read incase it might be an examI get so scared that I always think im going to fail and disappoint everyone ,my mum ,my dad and my elder sister they’re all counting on me but i keep thinking that im hoping to fail and I dont know what to do 😞I try and try and try but I never have the courage to face it because all my inner voices are of all the people in my life and what I feel like i would hear from them if I disappointed them and everything counts on this interview my whole life counts on it if I dont make it into this university I would just be the failure my mind keeps saying I amI really love your article i mean it even made me say all this I just hope I gather the courage I need to open my books and be proud of myself and tell myself that im not a failure that I willand I can succeed and that I eill pass this interview or exam

Thank you. I was feeling so insecure before but after seeing that many people have the same problem as me I can try to improve myself

In April 2020 I went on a short trip to pick up my daughter who was 36 hours away round trip was longer hit a snow storm. My fiance stayed home with excuses why he couldn’t come, he was off work due to shortage but was waiting to be called back in. He texted me along the way of my trip there were a few hours I didn’t here from him when I did text him that the roads were getting worse and the opp were going to be closing them. Earlier he bought some alcohol and said he was going to go to a buddies house. Months later I received a message from this girl who really likes my fiance saying she spent time with him they kisses showed me text messages. He denied everything because we know she like to break up relationships. But how did these text messages come about. Even his ex who he can’t stand and have a daughter together said he made passes at her to have a quicky. My insecurities are killing me every time he’s texting I come into the room he seems to hide it. I’m getting married in less then a month and I’m wondering if this is going to ruin us. Everytime I was to talk about it with him he gets mad for bringing it up. Idk what to do.

I’m getting to the point where I’m scared to go inside Walmart or even go out because I’m so insecure. I try to not care what other people think but I do. I feel like I’m not near as good enough as these other dudes and that messes with me.

I need help about my insecurity am going to lose my relationship because of it. I feel so much doubt in me that I don’t know how to get out of it

I have been having gender crisis recently and im scared that it might ruin my realationship. 🙁

I’m insecure about a lot of things. I’m insecure about things like how I am physically including my voice, my gender, my race, my sexuality, my skin, my height, my hair and face and eyes, etc, and it also comes down to things like what i enjoy doing. I am an artsy highschool kid, but the most I can manage is a quick doodle before i get frustrated and get too angry and discouraged to continue.

I didn’t think I would get good at anything. Everyone told me that I sucked at everything, and that I wasn’t trying, and that If I was, I wasn’t trying hard enough. People constantly compared me to other kids, sometimes people who went to the same church or school, or even kids around the globe that appear on screen. My mother signed me up for many kinds of lessons when I was a kid including Ballet, Karate, Piano, Singing, but I pulled out of each one, and my mother would constantly berate me for pulling out and still does to this day. I don’t want to try talking to her about it because she often just says that I’m not strong enough and I need to toughen up, and Maybe that’s true and I’m just overreacting, but I’m not sure. I am an excessively shy person that goes out of their way to avoid talking to people, and as much as I want to talk to people I always get too afraid at the last minute. My mother hates how shy I am, and always tells me to change. I try, but I don’t feel like anybody understands how mentally challenging it is to force yourself to do something that stabs directly at what you’re insecure about. I’ve said many weird things and had many bad encounters with people that have become the product of my fears and overwhelmedness, including acting freaked out when someone says something normal, going sour when someone reminds me take care of myself, running away from home and school.

I think it’s easier for me to say these things here because I’m behind a screen and nobody here really can know who I am. I am a hesitant person that when acting, often acts on impulse and out of fear or anger. Thanks for reading this far.

Key takeaways:

Low self-confidence, or insecurity, involves feeling inadequate or not good enough. Everyone experiences it from time to time, but it usually doesn’t last forever.

Insecurity can stem from a variety of factors. These include: childhood experiences, comparison to others, trauma, uncertainty, and discrimination.

Fortunately, by taking the steps and getting the right support, you can learn to boost your self-esteem and self-confidence.

If you’ve been feelinginsecurelately, you’re not alone. Everyone experiences times when they feel like they're not good enough. We may worry about our ability to navigate our future, jobs, or relationships. And we may question whether we have what it takes to cope with whatever challenges lie ahead.

Insecurity can stem from all sorts of experiences and, when it persists, can take a toll on your mental health. But fortunately, there arestrategiesyou can use to boost your self-confidence and harness your inner strength.

Insecurity can be caused by a wide variety of circumstances and life experiences.

Some experts believe that insecurity is caused by difficult childhood experiences. This idea has roots inattachment theory, which states that our early relationships with primary caregivers impact our adult relationships.

So, for example, experiencing inconsistent parenting as a child might make it harder for you to feel safe and secure in adult relationships. Other childhood difficulties that can contribute to insecurity include:

Relationships with caregivers that don't the meet child's needs

Resource insecurity (like not having housing or adequate food)

Exposure to trauma such as abuse, neglect, community violence, or natural disasters

Comparing yourself to others can also lead to insecurity and hurt your self-esteem. This is especially a concern in our era of rampant social media use. Consumingeveryone else’s “highlight reel”may leave you feeling like you don’t measure up to social standards.

And wishing you had someone else’s job, house, relationship, or physical features can take a toll on your self-confidence. But it’s important to remember that what people share online is often far from the whole story.

Insecurity may also stem from what’s going on in the world around you or in your relationships. For example, in uncertain economic times, many people feelinsecure about their jobs. And it’s common to experienceinsecurity about relationshipsin the aftermath of a breakup or divorce.

People from marginalized or minority groups may experience systemic discrimination that can negatively impact their well-being. Facing oppression in the form ofracism or prejudicecan lead to a variety of difficultemotional experiencesthat may include insecurity.

When it comes to overcoming insecurity, you need to find the tools and strategies that work for you. Here are some tips to help you get started.

Remember that everyone feels insecure sometimes, and feeling this way doesn’t mean you’re flawed. Try tocultivate compassionfor yourself and your experiences.

Stop and challengenegative, critical thoughts. Try to focus on what’s really true about you and look for evidence of your strengths and talents.

Look for opportunities to surround yourself with heartfelt support. Spend time withpeople who uplift and appreciate you, and offer your support in return when you can.

If you’re living with chronic insecurity, chances are that it didn’t develop overnight. Remember that healing can take time. Look to make small improvements to your self-esteem and confidence each day, and forgive yourself if you slip back into old habits.

If you’re trying to overcome insecurity on your own but things aren’t getting better, it might be time to talk to a mental health professional. A therapist can help you:

Uncover the root of your insecurity

Understand how it manifests in your life

Work toward improving your self-esteem and confidence

Insecurity manifests in all sorts of ways, depending on the individual. But here are some examples of what it can look like:

Whenever you think about public speaking, you feel queasy. But now your best friend is getting married, and he wants you to make a toast at the reception. You worry you’ll fumble over your words and embarrass yourself, so you decline.

You and your significant other have been dating for several years. Things are going well, and you see a future with this person. However, youconstantly worrythat your partner will leave you. You repeatedly ask for reassurance even though your partner hasn’t done anything to compromise your trust.

You like exercising, so you follow several fitness influencers on social media for their workout recommendations. But lately, you’ve been feeling ashamed of your body. You wish you looked more like those influencers.

Your boss tells you that there’s an opening in your department for a supervisory role. She says you’d be a great fit and even offers to put in a good word with the hiring committee. But despite your proven track record with the company, you don’t see yourself as a leader, so you don’t apply.

Insecurity and low self-esteem are not mental health diagnoses. But living with chronic, severe insecurity can cause long-term effects on your mental health.

According to someresearch, there’s an unclear but pronounced relationship between low self-esteem, a lack of self-confidence, and certain mental health conditions, such as:

Anxiety

Depression

Eating disorders

Substance use disorders

Feeling insecure does not mean that you’ll develop one of these conditions. But people already living with a mental illnessmight be more susceptibleto insecurity. This could be due, in part, to the stigma surrounding mental health.

At its core, insecurity is all about feeling inadequate or believing you’re not good enough. A lack of confidence canaffect your behavior in many ways, including:

Avoiding opportunities due to a fear of being compared to others

Overly fixating on something in your life you feel isn’t up to standard (like your appearance or your income level)

Becoming reactive or upset when given feedback, even if it’s constructive

Withdrawing from social activities you used to enjoy because you worry people don’t like you

Not standing up for yourself or not seeking help if someone is bullying or harming you

Everyone experiences insecurity sometimes. When your confidence falters, feelings of inadequacy can flare up and damage your self-esteem. Left unchecked, this can take a damaging toll on your mental health and relationships. Fortunately, you can manage insecurity by having self-compassion, challenging negative thinking, and surrounding yourself with the right support.

We all feel insecure from time to time—whether we openly admit it or not. It's one of the most human feelings, and there's really no shame in it. What matters more is how you deal with your insecurities. Depending on how you respond to them, insecurities often deteriorate one's self-esteem, so it's important to learn how to deal with them properly—and ideally, eventually, overcome them.

According to sex and relationship therapistEmily Jamea, Ph.D., LPC, LMFT, insecurity can be described as a feeling of doubt that your thoughts, feelings, behaviors, or other aspects of yourself are not valid or worthwhile. This self-doubt is often triggered by our experiences or interpersonal situations.

"A common misconception is that insecure people are shy and withdrawn. While this may be true for some people, others may appear outwardly confident. Sometimes it is not until you get to know someone on a deeper level that their self-doubt and insecurity become apparent," Jamea says.

Another common misconception is that being insecure is a character trait, when really it's a feeling or state of being, according to licensed clinical psychologistAvigail Lev, Psy.D.

"If our mind confuses insecurity for a character trait, then every time the feeling of insecurity gets triggered for us, we will assume that something is wrong with us," she explains. "If we view insecurity as a feeling state that gets triggered for everyone, then we have more compassion with it and kindness toward it, which allows for more acceptance of it."

There are many reasons why someone might feel insecure. Even people who are ordinarily confident may develop feelings of insecurity because someone made them doubt themselves.

Jamea says this is common in cases of getting made fun of or being bullied—whether as a child or adult—or because of rejection, like after a breakup or not being included in an activity with friends.

People may also experience insecurity because they feel they do not live up to societal norms. "It's common for women to feel insecure about their bodies and for men to feel insecure about their earnings," she says, for example.

Additionally, some people may be insecure because of the family system they grew up in. Jamea says children who were criticized for expressing themselves or simply not given the space to express themselves often evolve into adults who are insecure.

As mentioned, a lot of our insecurities stem from the messages we receive from society, family, friends, and peers about who and what we should be. These standards are often unrealistic and include everything from how bodies should look to what we should achieve personally and professionally by a certain age, and more.

We then compare ourselves to these standards and if we feel we fall short, insecurities develop, according to psychotherapistShannon Garcia, LCSW.

"Your ability to manage these insecure thoughts as they arise will determine how deep-rooted insecurities become," she adds. "Your history, support network, past trauma, current stress levels, and more affect your ability to respond to negative self-talk and negative messages from others. The good news is, you can retrain your brain to overcome current insecurities and protect from future ones."

Ourinsecurities within our relationshipsalmost always bloom from insecurity within ourselves. The way we show up in relationships comes from the way we view relationships, which comes from our past experiences and starts the moment we are born.

According to Garcia, how your primary caregiver (usually parents) responded to your needs as a child develops yourattachment style. These attachment styles are a major factor in how a person reacts in relationships.

"If you consistently struggle with insecurity in relationships, you may haveanxious attachment style. Anxious attachment develops when caregivers respond sporadically to a child's needs. Sometimes needs are met, and sometimes they are not," she explains.

According to Jamea, folks with an anxious attachment style may experience feelings of doubt that their partner truly cares about them, that they might leave, or that they must love their partners more than they love them. People with this attachment style often get wildly anxious andtriggeredduring conflict and may appear desperate to win back their partner's love.

"Someone bragging about themselves, their accomplishments, and their life constantly is often a sign of a person feeling insecure and having a need to convince themselves that they are worth it," explains licensed mental health counselorRachna Buxani-Mirpuri, LMHC.

Buxani-Mirpuri also notes, "People who are insecure can be very controlling. It makes an insecure person very anxious if they are not able to control their environment and everyone who is a part of it. Thus, an insecure person can be very controlling toward their romantic partners."

Sometimes, insecurity can manifest through an incessant desire to please others. "People-pleasing tendencies tend to reflect insecurity and the resulting internal craving for acceptance," says clinical psychologistCarla Marie Manly, Ph.D.

Another sign of insecurity is constant jealousy. Manly says, although jealousy is a natural feeling, those who are constantly jealous of others are often extremely insecure.

Seeking excessive reassurance can look like asking the same questions repeatedly and at times compulsively.

According to Garcia, common reassurance-seeking questions in relationships include "Are you mad at me?" and "Do you love me?" If one is feeling insecure about their body image, it may be repeatedly asking "Do I look OK?"

If your loved ones get frustrated by your frequent questions, it may be because you are subconsciously seeking reassurance.

According to Garcia, perfectionism is the false belief of needing to be perfect to be accepted by others or even to be accepted by yourself, and it's rooted in insecurity. You feel you must be perfect at home, at work, and/or in your relationships. You set unattainable standards for yourself and exhaust yourself attempting to reach these.

Recognize that you are good enough, and no number of accomplishments, monetary or otherwise, will ever be enough for you to feel internally secure.

Instead of always looking to what's next or how where you are now isn't far enough, learn to appreciate where you are and what is in the here and now.Mindfulness practicescan be very helpful in this regard, says clinical psychologistNoël Hunter, Psy.D., which leads us to our next point.

"These practices have been around for thousands of years for a reason—human suffering around insecurity and anxiety has been a central struggle for as long as humans have existed. These practices have stuck around because they work," Hunter says.

In addition to mindfulness andmeditation, Hunter also suggests learning to attune to your internal state and let go of tension, as well as generallyacting in a loving and gentle way toward yourself, which can make a tremendous difference in how you eventually feel about yourself.

Negative self-talkis the most common symptom of insecurity, says Jamea. One way to counteract that is through the use of writing, she suggests. "Writing down your automatic negative thought, then actively restructuring it into a positive thought, can go a long way in overcoming insecurity."

She offers an additional tip for this exercise: "If you're struggling to flip the thought, ask yourself what you'd say to a friend who had that negative thought. Once you write down the alternative or balanced thought, reassess your feelings and notice if your worry and anxiety has lessened."

Lev suggests practicing self-compassion techniques daily. For example, she says, this might look like putting your hand on your heart, identifying and validating feelings and needs, and sayinglovingkindness phrasesto yourself. For example, "It makes sense that I feel insecure. It makes sense that I feel anxious. It makes sense that I need security. May I feel secure, may I accept myself as I am. Everyone feels insecure. I'm doing my best."

"Insecure people worry excessively about what others think of them," says Jamea. "Letting go of this concern can do wonders to help you overcome feelings of insecurity. Participating in a 'letting go' ritual is an effective strategy. Write down what you think others think of you on strips of paper. Then systematically let go of it by throwing it into a fire or letting it go with a balloon."

If you find that certain actions or people trigger insecurity, take a step back. Instead of subjecting yourself to situations or people that worsen your insecurity, Manly recommends making a pact with yourself that you'll mindfully do more of what does feel good. So, if social media or a certain person make you feel worse about yourself, do yourself a huge favor and let go, she says.

According to Lev, emotion exposure is a technique incognitive behavioral therapythat involves letting go of thoughts, embracing emotions, and labeling sensations in the body. It's a mindfulness practice that is meant to help people cultivate acceptance of difficult thoughts and feelings.

"When you practice emotion exposure, you notice where in your body the feeling of insecurity feels most intense, you label and track the level of intensity from 0 to 100%, you physicalize the sensations, and practice distancing and defusing from thoughts," she explains.

"Physicalizing sensations involves staying present and tracking sensations in your body by asking yourself what color, shape, texture, temperature, and movement each sensation has in your body and staying open, present, and curious about the physiological experience of the emotion. You continue nonjudgmentally labeling all the different sensations in your body, where they are, physicalizing them, and coming back to tracking the intensity from 0 to 100%."

She adds that the exercise may not feel good in the moment, but in the long run, it helps you make more space for those difficult feelings and have more self-compassion around them.

If you're dealing with insecurities, you might be asking yourself how much is too much? But according to Lev, there's no such thing as too much of a feeling of insecurity.

"Feelings are not problematic. Feelings give us information about what matters and what's important to us. Behaviors can be problematic. If we engage in maladaptive coping mechanisms such as withdrawing, accusing, procrastinating, defending, clinging, and/or attacking when we're feeling insecure, then it becomes a problem," she says.

The feeling itself is not a problem. We have the same choice to move toward our values whether we feel secure or insecure. We can feel insecure at times and still move toward being honest, authentic, curious, empathic, assertive, and kind.

Cultivating self-compassion is the ultimate key to overcoming your insecurities. It's important to offer yourself grace throughout your journey of healing and growing. Approach your feelings and triggers with curiosity. That way, you can understand them and ultimately use that knowledge to improve your self-confidence and free yourself from your insecurities. Or at the very least, better manage the way you process those feelings.

How can I be more confident in myself?


Suffering From Lack of Self-Confidence? | Sadhguru - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwLVRzAGjkw

Transcript:
(00:00) Sadhguru: Because I don’t have any confidence about anything. But I have clarity. If you are just confident, you will blunder through life. You must extinguish your confidence and bring clarity. Ria: So Sadhguru, you are so revered, and you are so cherished, do you ever get a superiority complex? Sadhguru: Right now, yes. (Laughter) See, the question is not about superiority complex, inferiority complex, poverty complex, or wealthy complex. That you have a complex, is a serious problem, isn't it? Whatever kind it is! What a complex means is, you have assumed something about yourself, and you have concretized that assumption in such a way, you make a bloody fool of yourself wherever you go. Do I look like that? Hello? Do I look like I’m making a bloody fool of myself with you? Ria: No. Sadhguru: No. So... (Laughs) no complex - of any kind. Ria: All right. But then our confidence fluctuates every day, so what do you have to say about that? Sadhguru: Because I don’t have any confidence about anything - I just have clarity. People think I have knowledge. No, my head is empty. That’s why, to make it look little substantial, I have a turban. (Laughter/Applause) It’s totally empty always, but I have clarity. Clarity means what? You see things the way they are. Knowledge means what? You have fixed information about everything. If things have changed, you will not see it the way it is. That’s as good as being blind. See, people think owls are blind. It’s not true! Their vision is far more sensitive than yours, but because of sunlight they're blinded, because it’s too much. When light goes down, he sees very clearly - not because he’s blind - because his eyes are super sensitive. So, it’s important that you bring clarity to your life, not knowledge, because knowledge is conclusions that you gather. Knowledge is okay when you're trying to do something physical, material in the world, but not with life. Is it true what you thought was absolute at the age of 12, today is not true? Yes, or no? Are you sure that whatever you think is “this is it” right now, will be “this is it” in another 3 years’ time? Ria: Of course not. Sadhguru: You know that. So you know you're wrong. (Chuckles) Yes, or no? Ria: Yes. Sadhguru: So, you know anyway you're wrong. So, why assert the wrong things? Well, right now we are wrong, at least let’s manage with little… little more conscious; if you know you're wrong, you will walk carefully, isn't it? Hello? But you think you're absolutely correct, then you will do stupid things, and you blunder around the world. If you know you're not seeing properly, will you walk carefully, or no? If I asked you to walk through a dark room, suppose we turn off all the lights and close it down, everything, pitch dark, if I ask you to walk, suddenly will you become super alert and conscious as to how you walk? But when the lights are on, you're just going unconsciously, bumping into everybody. So, if you learn to walk every moment like there are no lights, and you're looking at everything absolutely carefully, then what you see clearly, you go through it, what you don’t see clearly, you hesitate. Some places you take a little bit of chance. But if you are just confident, you will blunder through life, we don’t know where you will get in, and what you will get trapped into. Most people are trapped into their professions, their family situations, their social situations in such a way, they all became like this... (Gestures) Yes? Already I’m seeing not just older people, youth have become like this. “What will happen to me at the end of my life? What will happen to me at the end of my life?” I’ve already revealed the secret - you will die. (Laughter/Applause) “But Sadhguru, if this happens what to do, if that happens what to do?” All those things will happen! It’s not that everything will happen in your life the way you like it. Things will happen in the way you don’t like it. It once happened. Shankaran Pillai got fired from his job, (Few laugh) simply because he asked a question: “Smoking or non-smoking?” How can you get fired for asking such a simple question? “Smoking or non-smoking?” he asked, and he got fired. Because what he was supposed to ask was, “Cremation or burial?” (Laughter/Applause) So, many times what you do, thinking “I’m right” may be irrelevant to the situation in which you exist. So, the most important aspect of your life is, you're relevant, not right - you're just relevant. To the existing situation, you're relevant. “I’m right, I’m right, I’m right!” This is confidence. You being right, nobody cares. All the idiots who think they're right, nobody wants to listen to them, nobody wants to be around them, isn't it? People who always think “I’m right, I’m right,” you want to be around them? No, the important thing is, you're relevant to the situation in which you exist. If you have to bring relevance into your life, you must extinguish your confidence and bring clarity. To develop clarity there are many systems. See, to develop your muscle, there are systems, isn't it? Similarly, to develop clarity, there are many systems. Unfortunately, our education system is dulling clarity in so many ways. Some of the research studies in the university shows that, if a child goes to kindergarten and goes through 20 years of education – I’m sorry I’m saying this is an educational institution – 20 years of education and comes out, let’s say, with a PhD. They are saying, 70% of their intelligence is irrevocably destroyed. So, you have a knowledgeable idiot. What do you do with this? Well, you can impress people by throwing information, but this whole game of impressing people, throwing this information and that information around, is all going to go, because that Google lady is better than any of these idiots! (Laughter) Hello? (Laughter/Applause) You… it’s really amazing, I’m just traveling to wherever. Let’s say, I’m flying to United States or Africa, somewhere. I just ask, you know, “What is the morning temperature in Entebbe? I’m landing there.” Without batting an eyelid, in 2 seconds she tells me, "It’s 14 °C and by afternoon it’s 18 °C, by evening it’s again 12 °C. Who could ever say this? (Chuckles) Hello? She may not be perfectly right, but she’s almost there. So, people who are carrying a basket of information on their head and feeling superior, I want you to understand this: in this country, and everywhere else in the world, in the… not the previous, but the previous generation, somebody who could read a book was seen god-like, because everybody else was illiterate. And people thrived simply because they can read the Gita, or the Bible, or something else. They thrived simply because they can read. But once everybody can read, we are ignoring those people completely. Yes, or no? Hello? Participants: Yes. Sadhguru: So, people who are carrying information and feeling superior, they will all be made into nothing in the next 15 to 20 years’ time. Once artificial intelligence becomes all over the place, information will mean nothing! Because it will be available everywhere. By then, you must be competent to do something beyond information. This is why I’m with you. (Applause/Laughter)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5dzGeQ94mc

Transcript:
(00:01) you need to love yourself you need to build your self-esteem and I think the first step to loving yourself and building your self-esteem is to ask yourself why don't you love yourself or accept the fact that you're not happy with yourself except that you have low self-esteem and then you should ask why typically it's something you know from the past some type of trauma or something you've been through something somebody else said you know what happened outside of you what did somebody do what did somebody
(00:34) say and you recognize that you feel the way you do because of the experience you had outside of yourself because someone taught you to hate yourself let's let's put it bluntly somebody taught you to hate yourself somebody taught you to dislike something about yourself some experience taught you to be insecure about something so what is it you have to be real with yourself and you have to dig down and find that so to help y'all out to be more relatable and to be more you know descriptive I guess we could say
(01:12) I'm going to demonstrate so you can do an exercise you can talk to your younger self and reform this bond with your younger self so that you can learn yourself accept yourself and eventually fall in love with yourself so if I was talking to my younger self I would say it's okay that no one really understands you it's okay that people often look over you that's fine because one day they are going to see you be great and I'm telling you that because I know and I believe in you and I love you
(01:44) and the things you say they actually do matter and don't worry about being short you'll get taller and if you don't it's okay because taller people they ultimately die sooner their heart has to work so much harder to pump that blood and there's nothing wrong with your nose and there's nothing wrong with your eyes you're beautiful you know what I'm saying you my G and you going to be all right anything you want to do in life you can do it don't worry about people who told you is too small don't worry

(03:09) things that made me feel left out but it wasn't from inside of me it was an outside of outside experience something else happened outside of me and it influenced the way I see myself within me but buddy that is corrupt my friend that is corrupt so you have to dig back into yourself and reform that Bond like look bro we good like I love myself I'm tripping I'm seeing myself Through The Eyes of a distorted lens or a distorted person or someone's distorted and ignorant Viewpoint and that's not healthy for you

(04:12) of you right and you become very close with them you form a deep connection with them did you always know them absolutely not now it gets to the point where you can read their thoughts you know what I'm saying y'all can sit in the room and talk without even talking well my friend you have to do that with yourself do that with yourself become curious about yourself how when was the last time you asked yourself a question when was the last time you asked yourself a question really be honest and I don't mean like uh what's
(04:44) going to happen today I mean like a real question like bro how are you feeling I look in the mirror sometimes be like bro how do you feel like truly I be like man I ain't really feeling it today but it's okay you know what I'm saying we'll deal with what we got to deal with and then we going we going to get out of here we going to have a great day when was the last time you really checked up on yourself when was the last time you showed up for yourself and my creative mind is really going to understand this
(05:10) when I say this but I went in a very dark place sometime last year because I would go to a job work x amount of hours and then come home and wouldn't get in front of this camera and create for myself so I can go put 8 hours in a day or more for some people who don't give a rat behind about me right but I can't come home and work for myself no sir so all you good people y'all applaud for everybody y'all show up for everybody y'all Listen to Everybody y'all take care of everybody but you won't do that
(05:46) for you that's where the flaw is that's where you missing out on that's the problem and like I said I understand you know things happen you know in our past that are traumatic but we got to heal from that but in order to heal from it you got to be real with yourself that is the first step to learning yourself or the first step to loving yourself is learning yourself and thear the first step to learning yourself is knowing what you've been through and why you act the way you do sorry for the Mush Mouth there but I
(06:22) was it was so much going on in my head right but you just got to know yourself very very well so stop looking through the eyes of other people to judge you like I know people who like oh I got to make sure I'm I'm looking good and make sure nobody it don't matter bro it don't matter I will walk into waffle waffle house with crust in my eyes at 3:00 in the morning and I don't care I walk into anywhere am I going to do that no because you know what I mean I like to look good for me I like to keep
(06:56) myself up like that but if I was to ever do that you know what I'm saying I don't give a damn what anybody thinks you know what I'm saying I'll go to a tuxedo party in pajamas cuz I'm comfortable right and then everybody be trying to put on pajamas because of the the the energy I'm going to exude like damn that he comfortable I guess I might as well put on you know what I'm saying but that's that's just that's the reason why we so far stretch from ourselves is because we living life
(07:26) Through The Eyes of other people through the minds of other people people buy clothes bro what you think about this jacket bro what do you think about that jacket I like it get it bro what you think about my girl she's fine for you it's not my type I don't I don't have to say all those things but like bro hone in on you but what I'm going leave you with you know on on your journey to um look I'm I'm sitting here R I'm I haven't even ate my food but journey to loving yourself
(08:01) it's difficult but a trick I like to use and you'll hear me repeat this a lot throughout our journey together but be delusional lie to yourself when I first started my journey of loving myself you know I hated my nose I hated my face I literally used to like try to pull my face and stretch my face and stuff because I hated my face because people used to talk about me I used to want different parents and all that stuff to get different genetics crazy stuff bro it's crazy what you can do to your own
(08:31) self or what your mind can do to you like crazy stuff but I learned to love myself and you know I started with you know getting my my hair right getting my clothes right you know fitting into my own style becoming comfortable and I was like you know what I like my nose you know what I like my eyes you know what I like my face I'm handsome I'm handsome I'm handsome I'm a beautiful young man right and eventually my mind was like you know what you really don't look that bad like I'm sure there some people who
(09:12) would love to have your genetics you know what I mean you really don't look too bad and then when I started to believe it then people would come through and say hey man you're pretty handsome you know and more people and more people and more people and more people and now present day and I say this humbly but I don't go a day without a compliment whether it's on my hair my looks my jewelry whatever it is energy and it's because I love me and I own me and I'm not a ashamed of me and I'm connected with myself and
(10:04) people see that it is a rare commodity it is a rare commodity to see someone fully connected with thems in love with themselves and exuding that that real confidence not that chest out you know what I'm saying red pill bravado whatever they call you know I own the place yeah walk in it like you own it but you smooth like you know what I'm saying hey how y'all doing you love yourself and you going to run into people who are jealous of you but as I said before my philosophy of jealousy is just Twisted
(10:41) admiration you're never jealous of something that you don't want or that you don't desire or a person's life that you don't desire so it's just Twisted admiration I hate you because I love you right I have loved many people with deep deep deep deep deep strength not very many have been close to me but I've had people that were close to me insult me about how much I love myself and it's very disheartening when a person resents you for loving yourself or they twistedly admire you or let's
(11:25) call it SP to Spade they are jealous because you love yourself but the problem is don't love themselves and they are so caught up in the admiration of you loving yourself while caught up in you admiring yourself right they hate the fact that they admire you while you're admiring yourself that they are blind to the fact that you love them and you try to enforce the ideas of them loving themselves they are so blind by their own self-esteem and and what I'm really trying to say here is that sometimes you are
(12:13) blinded by your own Twisted admiration for yourself for other people when you could simply just drop all the BS and just love yourself St and let people love you it's hard but it's not it's as hard as you make it and you will make it easy because I got you I got you
(13:17) [Music] so if you want to start your journey begin to ask yourself deep questions learn who you are and why you feel the way you do and understand that you feel the way you do because of outside experience I had this beautiful lady I was in contact with and she broke me down one day she told me that she didn't deserve to be loved and it broke my heart it pissed me off and I just kept hitting this this little piece of like a little platform I was like do not sit here and tell me that you don't deserve to be
(14:14) loved right and I went through I was like you literally make me feel like I'm flying all my bad days diminish because of you never experienced anything like this in my life because of you and you going to sit there and tell me you don't deserve to be loved really why is that tell me because that's what you know the same people that taught you how to use a fork and a spoon they probably taught you that well that excuse my profanity that stuff is over with if you with me we we we going we going we going to
(15:10) rewire all of that we going to re all of that I don't subscribe to that everybody deserves love what's the exception of some nasty Wicked cruel people out there we're not worried about them when I say everybody deserves love I'm talking about all you good people all the people in my community all my trib mates all the high vibrational beings we not worried about the low-level scum right it's out the way some things that people do I I can't I can't forgive certain thing we don't have to get into those
(15:58) details but like I said if you around me I don't want to hear no I don't love myself I don't deserve love none of that cuz we F to work on all of that so if you think you're not worthy tell me how in the hell are you watching this video how in the hell did you get out of bed this morning cuz somebody thought you was worthy you got life in your body air in your lungs blood in your veins somebody love you so why shouldn't you just love yourself I love [Music] you and you love you too you know you

Many people can lack confidence in certain situations. Perhaps you feel unsure of yourself after speaking up in a meeting, going to a party where you didn't know anyone, or trying something new. It's natural to feel this way, and it can happen to anyone. Now, imagine having a strong sense of confidence during these situations instead of feeling unsure. Confidence allows you to believe in yourself and your abilities and to feel comfortable in your own skin, knowing you've got this, no matter what it is.

If you ever feel low in confidence, understanding what’s happening and why can help. And when you recognize a lack of self-confidence, having some tips in your back pocket can help you become more self-assured.

Confidence isn’t just about feeling good because you’re having a good hair day or wearing your favorite outfit, although that can help. Confidence is about how you carry yourself every day. When you're confident, you feel steady and sure no matter what's going on around you.

Having confidence can bring a host of benefits:

Healthier lifestyle choices

Success in the workplace

Positive social interactions

Resilience

Happiness

Better decision making

Less fear and anxiety

Confidence can help you live your best life. It's the foundation for many outcomes, from your health to your career to your relationships. And the best part is that confidence can be learned and strengthened over time.

Confident people often seem like they have a certain vibe about them—it's as if they walk into a room and just know they belong there. Of course, even confident people have off days and areas that they struggle, but if you’re looking to increase your confidence, you can start by looking at these traits. Which ones do you see in yourself already? Which ones could you work on? Confidence isn't about being perfect. It's about being comfortable with who you are and knowing that you're valuable, just as you are.

They take risks:Confident people may be less afraid to step out of their comfort zone. They know that to grow, you have to try new things, even if it means you might not succeed every time.

They’re optimistic:Confident people may be more positive and expect good things to happen. Even when things go wrong, they can see those experiences and even failures as a chance to learn and get better.

They accept compliments:When someone says, "Hey, great job," a confident person has an easier time saying, "thank you," instead of shrugging it off. They're not bragging—they just know their worth.

They're decisive:Confident people find it easier to make decisions and stick to them. They trust their instincts and don't waste time worrying about what everyone else might think.

They set boundaries:Knowing when to say yes and when to say no is a sign of confidence. Confident people can respect their own limits and aren't afraid to communicate them to others.

They're not pretenders:Confident people are more comfortable being who they are and don't feel the need to pretend to be someone they're not.

They listen more than they speak:Surprisingly, confident people often listen more than they talk. They're secure enough to know they don't always have to be the loudest voice in the room.

Recognizing low confidence is the first step to building it up. Look out for key signs that might suggest your confidence isn't at its peak. If any of these signs sound familiar, don't worry—it's completely normal. The good news is that confidence is something you can improve.

Worrying about others' opinions:If you find yourself constantly wondering what others think about you or your work, it might be a sign that your confidence could use a boost.

Feeling anxious:It's normal to feel a bit nervous now and then, but if you're frequently anxious, especially about everyday things, it could be tied to low self-confidence.

Avoiding eye contact:Not looking someone in the eye during a conversation might mean you're not feeling too sure of yourself.

Shying away from challenges:If you tend to back down when things get tough or you're faced with a challenge, it might be because you're not feeling confident in your ability to handle it.

Negative self-talk:Pay attention to how you talk to yourself. If you oftensay negative thingslike "I can't," or "I'm not good enough," it's time to address your self-confidence.

Overthinking:Spending too much time mulling over decisions or worrying about the future can be a symptom of low confidence.

Fear of failure:Everyone fears failing at times, but if the fear is so strong that it stops you from trying new things, it's likely linked to low self-confidence.

If you’re ready to build self-confidence, start applying a few tips today. Take these steps one at a time—there's no rush, and every step inches you closer to a more confident you.

Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and moving your body in ways that feel good. When you feel good physically, it can help you feel better about yourself mentally.

💙 Discover what’s on the other side of fear byTaking the Exquisite Riskwith Tara Brach.

It’s easy to get lost in our own negative thoughts and feelings of self-doubt. If you can relate to this, try spending some time with people who lift you up and believe in you. Their positive energy can rub off on you.

Sometimes, your outside appearance can have an effect on how you feel inside. When you look good to you, you might feel good, too. If you need a confidence boost, try wearing clothes that make you feel comfortable and confident or sporting your favorite color for an instant mood boost.

When you help out someone else, it not only makes them feel good, but it can also boost your own confidence. Try giving back in your community in ways that matter, like by donating to a food pantry or walking dogs at your local animal shelter.

You don't have to agree to everything. Having boundaries and saying no when you need to is a sign of self-respect. This can mean having boundaries with friends or family, or even at your job. This isn’t to say you should be rigid, but make sure you’re prioritizing yourself in addition to others.

💙 New to boundaries? Learn how to setHealthy Boundarieswith Jeff Warren.

Start your day with a positive statement about yourself, or reminding yourself what you’re grateful for. Taking stock of what’s already going really right in your life can set a confident tone for the day.

💙 Practicing gratitude starts with identifying things you’re grateful for. Learn how to practice the art ofNoticingin this quick meditation.

Lacking confidence is something many people experience. It can come from various places, such as past experiences where things didn't go as planned, or harsh criticism that stuck with you. Sometimes, it's just a habit of thinking less of ourselves than we deserve. The key thing to remember is that it's okay to feel this way, and it's something you can work on improving.

Improving your self-confidence can be a fun and rewarding process.

Set personal goals and celebrate when you achieve them, no matter how small.

Talk to yourself with kindness, just like you would to a good friend.

Learn something new. It can be as simple as a new recipe or as challenging as a new language.

Exercise regularly to help improve your mood and energy levels.

Dress in clothes that make you feel good about yourself. When you look good, you often feel good, too.

Spend time with people who make you feel positive and support your growth.

Volunteer your time, as helping others can make you feel good about yourself.

Practice saying no when you need to—it's important to set boundaries for yourself.

You gain confidence when you start to see yourself in a positive light. It happens when you challenge yourself and succeed, or even when you don't succeed but realize it's not the end of the world. Each time you step out of your comfort zone, you're showing yourself that you're capable of more than you thought. Confidence grows when you learn to trust yourself and your abilities, and when you treat yourself with the same compassion and respect that you give to others.

Mental health is hard. Getting support doesn't have to be. TheCalm appputs the tools to feel better in your back pocket, with personalized content to manage stress and anxiety, get better sleep, and feel more present in your life.

Keeping your temper in check can be challenging. Use simple anger management tips — from taking a timeout to using "I" statements — to stay in control.

Do you fume when someone cuts you off in traffic? Does your blood pressure rocket when your child refuses to cooperate? Anger is a common and even healthy emotion. But it's important to deal with it in a positive way. Uncontrolled anger can take a toll on both your health and your relationships.

Ready to get your anger under control? Start by considering these 10 anger management tips.

In the heat of the moment, it's easy to say something you'll later regret. Take a few moments to collect your thoughts before saying anything. Also allow others involved in the situation to do the same.

As soon as you're thinking clearly, express your frustration in an assertive but nonconfrontational way. State your concerns and needs clearly and directly, without hurting others or trying to control them.

Physical activity can help reduce stress that can cause you to become angry. If you feel your anger escalating, go for a brisk walk or run. Or spend some time doing other enjoyable physical activities.

Timeouts aren't just for kids. Give yourself short breaks during times of the day that tend to be stressful. A few moments of quiet time might help you feel better prepared to handle what's ahead without getting irritated or angry.

Instead of focusing on what made you mad, work on resolving the issue at hand. Does your child's messy room make you upset? Close the door. Is your partner late for dinner every night? Schedule meals later in the evening. Or agree to eat on your own a few times a week. Also, understand that some things are simply out of your control. Try to be realistic about what you can and cannot change. Remind yourself that anger won't fix anything and might only make it worse.

Criticizing or placing blame might only increase tension. Instead, use "I" statements to describe the problem. Be respectful and specific. For example, say, "I'm upset that you left the table without offering to help with the dishes" instead of "You never do any housework."

Forgiveness is a powerful tool. If you allow anger and other negative feelings to crowd out positive feelings, you might find yourself swallowed up by your own bitterness or sense of injustice. Forgiving someone who angered you might help you both learn from the situation and strengthen your relationship.

Lightening up can help diffuse tension. Use humor to help you face what's making you angry and, possibly, any unrealistic expectations you have for how things should go. Avoid sarcasm, though — it can hurt feelings and make things worse.

When your temper flares, put relaxation skills to work. Practice deep-breathing exercises, imagine a relaxing scene, or repeat a calming word or phrase, such as "Take it easy." You might also listen to music, write in a journal or do a few yoga poses — whatever it takes to encourage relaxation.

Learning to control anger can be a challenge at times. Seek help for anger issues if your anger seems out of control, causes you to do things you regret or hurts those around you.

As a health care worker during the COVID-19 pandemic, you’ve probably dealt with some anger over the last few months, as the virus continues to take lives across the United States. With infection rates climbing once again, that anger may increase in intensity - what was once frustration may become full-blown rage. The circumstances causing this rage might be beyond your control (you can’t easily change how your government officials are handling COVID-19 in your community or force everyone to obey regulations), but you can control your own reactions. Relaxation techniques or mindfulness often work for lower intensity anger like frustration or annoyance, but with a feeling as high energy as rage, try to let that energy out in a safe way.

via GIPHY

Physically throwing something can relieve stress and be helpful in the immediate moment. Have a yard? Get out there with a ball or find some rocks to throw if you have enough space. Or smash something, like a mug or old piece of junk that you’ve been meaning to get rid of. If that’s not a realistic option, get creative - throw something soft (like balled up socks or a roll of toilet paper) against a blank wall or an apple into the woods (the birds will get it).

via GIPHY

When you can feel anger boiling inside you, yelling is often incredibly cathartic and can pull you out of that blind rage you may be experiencing. Take care to not startle or worry anyone (including nearby neighbors) by screaming into a pillow. If you’re at work and can take a break for a few minutes, your car is good option too.

via GIPHY

Put on some music that has anger in it – even if the artist’s anger is different from yours. Channeling your own feelings into the song and expressing that fury can help release some of your own anger.

via GIPHY

Dancing can be a great way to express your emotions, especially when they are so powerful that you can physically feel them in your body. Dance to angry music, happy pump-up music, or no music – just get that excess energy out.

via GIPHY

If dancing isn’t your thing, try another form of high energy exercise, like boxing or sprinting. You can search for free workout videos online or do your own thing, but make sure to push yourself and give it your all if you’re looking for that anger release. It might feel silly but yelling or grunting while working out might even help you exert more energy.

via GIPHY

Putting your feelings into words isn’t always easy and writing may not be your go-to technique, but if your mind is spiraling with angry thoughts, dumping them all out onto paper can bring some peace. It doesn’t have to be a big ordeal – even just typing a stream-of-consciousness note on your phone during a quick bathroom break can help calm your mind.

via GIPHY

Art is often a powerful way to confront your big feelings and turn them into something beautiful. Let go of your work being “good” – allow yourself to create solely to express yourself. Do what feels good rather than focusing on what will look good.

via GIPHY

When you can’t quiet your thoughts, a change of scenery – even just going into the next room or stepping outside for five minutes – can disrupt the track that your mind is on.

via GIPHY

Print out that email that set you off or write down the things that are upsetting you. Then scribble all over it, tear it up, or put it through the shredder.

via GIPHY

You can always vent to a trusted friend, but sometimes it feels better to pretend you’re talking directly to the person you’re angry at. Pick an empty chair, imagine they’re sitting in it, and yell, scream, or tell them exactly why you’re so mad – whatever feels best to you.

If you’re working to manage your feelings in a healthy way but it just seems impossible, take amental health screen– you may be dealing with symptoms of a mental health condition. For immediate support, you can reach out to Magellan Health’s COVID-19 first responder crisis line at (800) 327-7451, the Disaster Distress Helpline at (800) 985-5990, or the Crisis Text Line by texting MHA to 741-741 – all of these options will connect you to a trained crisis counselor 24/7/365.

Anger is a normal feeling and can be a positive emotion when it helps you work through issues or problems, whether that’s at work or at home.

However, anger can become problematic if it leads to aggression, outbursts, or even physical altercations.

Anger control is important for helping you avoid saying or doing something you may regret. Before anger escalates, you can use specific strategies for controlling anger.

Count down (or up) to 10. If you’re really mad, start at 100. In the time it takes you to count, your heart rate will slow, and your anger will likely subside.

Yourbreathingbecomes shallower and speeds up as you grow angry. Reverse that trend (and your anger) by taking slow, deep breaths from your nose and exhaling out of your mouth for several moments.

Exercisecan help calm your nerves and reduce anger. Go for a walk, ride your bike, or hit a few golf balls. Anything that gets your limbs pumping is good for your mind and body.

Progressive muscle relaxationcalls on you to tense and slowly relax various muscle groups in your body, one at a time. As you tense and release, take slow, deliberate breaths.

Find a word or phrase that helps you calm down and refocus. Repeat that word again and again to yourself when you’re upset. “Relax,” “Take it easy, and “You’ll be OK” are all good examples.

Neck rolls and shoulder rolls are good examples of nonstrenuous yoga-like movements that can help you control your body and harness your emotions. No fancy equipment required.

Slip into a quiet room, close your eyes, and practice visualizing yourself in a relaxing scene. Focus on details in the imaginary scene: What color is the water? How tall are the mountains? What do the chirping birds sound like? This practice can help you find calm amidst anger.

Letmusiccarry you away from your feelings. Put in earbuds or slip out to your car. Crank up your favorite music and hum, bop, or sashay your anger away.

When you’re steamed, you may be tempted to let the angry words fly, but you’re more likely to do harm than good. Pretend your lips are glued shut, just like you did as a kid. This moment without speaking will give you time to collect your thoughts.

Give yourself a break. Sit away from others. In this quiet time, you can process events and return your emotions to neutral. You may even find this time away from others is so helpful you want to schedule it into your daily routine.

Harness your angry energy. Sign a petition. Write a note to an official. Do something good for someone else. Pour your energy and emotions into something that’s healthy and productive.

What you can’t say, perhaps you can write. Jot down what you’re feeling and how you want to respond. Processing itthrough the written wordcan help you calm down and reassess the events leading up to your feelings.

You might be angry that your child has once again left their room a mess before going to visit a friend. Shut the door. You can temporarily end your anger by putting it out of your view. Look for similar resolutions in any situations.

Prevent an outburst by rehearsing what you’re going to say or how you’re going to approach the problem in the future. This rehearsal period gives you time to role-play several possible solutions, too.

The universal symbol to stop can help you calm down when you’re angry. It’s a quick way to help you visualize the need to halt yourself, your actions, and walk away from the moment.

If your slow commute to work makes you angry before you’ve even had coffee, find a new route. Consider options that may take longer but leave you less upset in the end.

Don’t stew in the events that made you angry. Help yourself process what happened bytalking with a trusted, supportive friendwho can possibly provide a new perspective.

Nothing upends a bad mood like a good one. Diffuse your anger by looking for ways to laugh, whether that’s playing with your kids, watching stand-up, or scrolling memes.

Take a moment to focus on what’s right when everything feels wrong. Realizing howmany good thingsyou have in your life can help you neutralize anger and turn around the situation.

The first thing that comes to mind when you’re angry likely isn’t the thing you should say. Give yourself a set time before you respond. This time will help you be calmer and more concise.

Write a letter or email to the person that made you angry. Then, delete it. Often, expressing your emotions in some form is all you want, even if it’s in something that will never be seen.

Finding the courage to forgive someone who has wronged you takes a lot of emotional skill. If you can’t go that far, you can at least pretend that you’re forgiving them, and you’ll feel your anger slip away.

Try to walk in the other person’s shoes and see the situation from their perspective. When you tell the story or relive the events as they saw it, you may gain a new understanding and become less angry.

It’s OK to say how you feel, as long as you handle it in the right way. Ask a trusted friend to help you be accountable to a calm response. Outbursts solve no problems, but mature dialogue can help reduce your stress and ease your anger. It may also prevent future problems.

Turn your anger into a tangible production. Consider painting, gardening, or writing poetry when you’re upset. Emotions are powerful muses for creative individuals. Use yours to reduce anger.

Anger is a normal emotion that everyone experiences from time to time. However, if you find your anger turns to aggression or outbursts, you need to find healthy ways to deal with anger.

If these tips don’t help, consider talking with your doctor. A mental health specialist or therapist can help you work through underlying factors that may contribute to anger and other emotional issues.

How do I heal from trauma?

Jordan Peterson Shares How To HEAL From Emotional Trauma | Lewis Howes - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed1KGYC1oXM

Transcript:
(00:03) it sounds to me and it looks to me like when I'm connecting with people that a lot of things from the past past memories past pains hurts traumas are being brought to the Forefront for a lot of people with the chaos of the now how do we start to heal the the memories of the past the traumas of the past uh so that they don't keep hurting us in the present well the first thing I would say is you know sometimes there's a crisis in well-meaning mental health professionals rush in to discuss the trauma well it's still happening that's
(00:48) a really bad idea people are generally traumatized because something actually horrible happened and dwelling on it in the moment just makes it worse it's not like anybody has a solution here's how you should understand this you know someone's just shot up your kid School here's how you should understand this that'll make it all better it's like no it won't if you have old baggage that often comes up if you're having an argument with someone doesn't it you know how it you know how it is
(01:27) this is partly why people don't like to have a dis dispute within a relationship because it's a thread and you pull on that thread and just God well that we had another rule do not agree with something you don't agree with oh like if we're gonna if we decide you and me that we're doing this we don't go back and say well I didn't really mean it we don't get to play revisionist with our history so if you if you don't agree don't agree fight object or hold your peace because you see what happens with
(02:04) couples is there's a little fight and then one says to the other yeah but you did this and then that person says yeah I know I did that but then that was because you did this and each this gets bigger until what's on the table is why the hell should we stay together at all right and so every fight becomes why the hell should we stay together at all so that's another thing you want to do is you want to have the fight about this thing not about everything past not everything it's like okay you were
(02:35) flirting I think you were flirting more than you should have been okay so I go away and I think well okay maybe I was okay um well then we have to have a discussion about why and maybe we can solve that but mostly what we have to do is figure out how to not have that happen again okay so we're going to go see the same couple again what is it that you want me to do so I'm the flirtatious one let's say what do you want me to do well you have to figure that out it's like no I'm stupid like you we're equally stupid I
(03:12) need to know what would satisfy you and you need to figure out what would satisfy you so I know and that like that's also extremely useful is let your establish your conditions of satisfaction make them explicit let the other person know yeah you can't read someone's mind yeah we're very bad at that we're bad at reading our own minds for that matter yeah so if we if I have a fight with with Tammy let's say sometimes I remember to say okay what what do you want me to do right now what can I
(03:48) do what what should I say and mean you know and you think well you shouldn't let the other person put words in your mouth well fair enough you know I'm not act I'm not asking for something false I'm saying I'd like to not have this happen can you see a way out is there something I could do to increase the probability that that's the route we could take and you know sometimes that works but the other person has to let you know what they would find satisfying you mention you mentioned sexual shame um and it triggered
(04:22) something in me about just the shames of the past that people tend to hold on to I think I might have mentioned this to you the last time we talked I'm not sure if you know but I was I was sexually abused when I was five by a man that I didn't know and for 25 years I held on to the secret the shame uh and if anyone ever knew about this then I would never be loved I you know right because you feel contaminated permanently yeah I would you know I wouldn't have any guy friends no girls would find me
(04:50) attractive my parents would disown me you know I went down the rabbit hole these stories of you know I'm the only one this has ever happened to I never saw any examples of this happening to right and about eight years ago I I started to really heal that and started sharing that shame in many different therapeutic experiences that allowed me to start the healing process uh I'm curious from your perspective with all the work that you've done what is the best approach for someone to really heal their shame if whether it's around
(05:24) sexual abuse or trauma or just anything whether it be small or big or any type of shame that they might have how does someone release shame in a healthy manner so that it doesn't make them a prisoner of these emotions of the past that hold them back well you hinted at a few things when you just described what what happened to you is you said well first of all you know I thought I was the only person this had ever happened to it's like no it's a universal Human Experience to one degree or another now you know I'm not saying
(06:01) everyone was sexually abused and I'm certainly not saying that some people aren't sexually abused to a degree that's so extreme it's unimaginable where their others you know get off relatively lightly but it's still it's it's well within the realm of normative Human Experience that sexual that sex goes wrong in some way at least you regret something that's happened something you've done or something that was done to you so the putting it in to when when you're the only person that
(06:34) something has happened to that's really not good right because it alienates you even from yourself you have no idea what to do with that and so that's sometimes why people find it such a relief to have their illness diagnosed it's like oh there is this is known there's a category other people have had this experience maybe there's a pathway through it so just knowing that you're not the only person like that can be very helpful um updating it's like how you were how old five okay well one
(07:09) thing to realize when you're 25 and you were abused when you're five is that you're not five anymore right right that the person to whom that happened is no longer there you're there but so you know you might feel afraid of relationships you might feel afraid of all sorts of things but a lot of that was you're sort of feeling that like that residual 5-year-old I tell a story about one client I had she was abused by her older brother and she told me the story and I drew a picture in my head while she was
(07:43) you know I kind of pictured her of at five and this teenage hulking teenager you know taking advantage of her but as she told the story I realized that her older brother was only a year two years older than her while he was seven was like okay well they were she wasn't the victim of a tyrannical male in some sense she they were two badly supervised children now that doesn't mean that what he did was right but she was still the 5-year-old in the memory but she was 27 when or so when she came to see me and so the first
(08:18) thing I did was just point that out it's like think about the seven-year-olds you know right from for a 5-year-old a seven-year-old is an adult but for an a seven and a 5-year-old are clearly both children well that just changed things somewhat it made her feel less vulnerable in the moment what your brain wants from you in relationship to a traumatic memory is indication that you're no longer vulnerable to the same problem that's what memory is for right you remember something bad and you process it so that
(08:53) you change your interpretation or your behavior or the situation or whatever you can change so that it isn't going to happen in the future and that'll if you do that thoroughly you'll generally let yourself rest it's to you have the memory to protect yourself from it happening again well that's the purpose of memory in general you you you you make sense of your past Behavior so that bet the good things that happen to you can be duplicated and the bad things can be avoided it's not to make an objective
(09:22) record of the world it's to make a functional map of the world that you can apply to the Future and so part of yeah how do we let that go how do we disassociate something that happened a year ago 10 20 years ago that is no longer happening but is seems to be triggering us oh it's very it's it's very difficult well I would say you know one of the things you need to develop if you've had an experience like the one you had perhaps because I don't know the details you probably need a theory of
(09:53) malevolence you need an explanation it's like how could a person do that well you have to have what if the explanation isn't good they were just bad person they just well then you need a philosophy of bad you need a philosophy of evil you have to understand it so that you're no longer a victim of it you have because otherwise you can't put the event in a in a context right you know and sometimes that means the development of real a real philosophical sophistication and that can help because then you know then you can start to
(10:29) separate out malevolence from benevolence because maybe you're afraid of any intimate relationship now because it's been contaminated with that and everything's fuzzy and foggy and so you need to understand the person who did that at least to some degree so that you can separate that person out from all the other people around you who that you encounter in situations that might be reminiscent of it you know so you you felt vulnerable for for per perhaps you felt ashamed all those things have to be gone through what do
(11:03) you think you know when you're ashamed when does what elicits that what are the eliciting cues what do you think when that happens all of that has to be taken apart I said in this Beyond order book that you know if you have a memory older than about 18 months that still bothers you right it's still got emotional resonance write older than 18 months ago or before yeah no older than 18 months ago or more got it yeah otherwise it's not really in the past right it's still happening that that whether you should delve into
(11:39) something how you should delve into something traumatic that's currently happening is a whole different issue but if it's an old memory and it still bothers you it means that you haven't decomposed that experience sufficiently to detach it from the emo emotion so imagine when something terrible happens to you you don't understand it so then you might saywell if you don't understand something that's happening to you how can it be terrible because doesn't terrible mean that you understand it and the the answer is well
(12:17) you understand things in stages and the first way you understand a terrible thing is by freezing in Terror or running that's the understanding it's not conceptual it's embodied and emotional and so event Terror that's the first category okay now the next question is how do you get it out how do you get out of the terror well you realize that nothing truly dangerous is happening well what if something truly dangerous did happen then you elaborate your view of the world to the point where you're no
(12:59) longer vulnerable to that terrible thing and that's extremely difficult so the memory of something terrible stays terrible until you effortfully process it and decompose it into well often into a much more sophisticated map of the world and it's really hard to do that


6 ways to heal trauma without medication | Bessel van der Kolk | Big Think - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoZT8-HqI64

Transcript:
(00:01) - I was raised in the mainstream culture where if you feel bad, you take something to make that feeling go away. Around that time that I first started to work for the VA, I looked at the treatments that we have. I did the first study on Prozac for PTSD, the first study for Zoloft for PTSD, and a number of other conventional drugs.
(00:25) What we found is they didn't work very well. Our conventional way of thinking about it is not working. I thought, "Okay, if it doesn't work, let's see what else could work." My name is Bessel van der Kolk. I am a physician, I'm a psychiatrist. I have been studying trauma for about 50 years now.
(00:55) The nature of trauma is that something happens to you, your survival brain makes the first interpretation and says, is this dangerous or is this safe? So it's very important to really be aware that these reactions emanate for your body. And so, the big challenge of treating trauma is how do we help people to live in bodies that feel fundamentally safe? What was very clear is that very good psychotherapy is actually quite helpful.
(01:30) Not to fix people, but helping people to acknowledge, oh my God, that was terrible what happened to me. And I need to take care of the wounds that I'm carrying inside of myself. This issue of self-compassion and really knowing that your reactions are understandable is a terribly important part of beginning to recover from trauma.
(01:58) Can I talk about something else before we talk about MDMA? Because MDMA is so sexy. Okay. For me, the opening to a new world came when some people in my clinic started to do something very strange, called EMDR. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. You ask people to call up the memory of what you saw back then, what you felt back then.
(02:29) And then what you do is that you ask people to follow your fingers as you move your fingers from side to side. And my first reaction was like, "Man, stop this crazy nonsense, this is a crazy method." And then I got to see some of the results, I go like, "Wow, this is interesting." Wiggling your fingers and full of people's eyes as they think about the trauma made the trauma go away.
(02:58) This crazy eye movement desensitization actually change the circuitry of the brain to interpret your current reality from a different angle. This had amazing effects on people being able to let go of what happened. They say, "Yes, that's what's happened to me. And it happened a long time ago. It's not happening right now.
(03:22) " That was the first time that I saw a non-conventional technique have a very profound effect. And then we studied yoga. Maybe if you do yoga, you can open up your relationship to your body. You learn how to breathe calmly, you learn to pay attention to yourself, you get to see how different movements and different postures affect you.
(03:46) And so you form a deep relationship with your internal sensory system. Yoga, at the end, was a more effective treatment for PTSD than any of the drugs we had studied. But I've yet to see a psychopharmacology clinic being transformed to a yoga studio. The next thing that we studied was theater and movement.
(04:11) And it turns out that playing different roles in your body helps you to feel that your body can feel differently, depending on how you organize your relationship to yourself. When my voice gets too gravelly, let me know and I'll drink some water. - It's feeling a little gravelly, so why don't- - Okay.
(04:32) (upbeat music) It's good? All right. So, I live in the Berkshires and we have a great program here, called "Shakespeare in the Courts" where if you're a juvenile delinquent in this county, you have a 50% chance that a judge will condemn you to become a Shakespearian actor. That's civilization, huh? The Shakespeare program is enormously helpful because it helps people to feel their bodies and to feel what it feels like to be a king, what it feels like to be a warrior.
(05:12) And you get to really have a deep experience of yourself in different possibilities. The next piece that I studied is that you can actually put electrodes on your skull so that when you make brainwaves that help you to be calm and focused, you get a little reward. We did very well with neurofeedback. So we can shape your brain to actually have a different configuration to be open to new experiences.
(05:44) And then, about 15 years ago, two guys came to talk to me and they said, "Bessel, you know a lot about trauma. But do you think about his idea? We are thinking about psychedelics. What do you think about psychedelics for trauma?" And I go like, "Wow! You're speaking for my heart," because of course, I'm a child of the sixties and we dabbled in LSD and psychedelic substances.
(06:12) Wouldn't it be great if he could do psychedelic substances to see if these substances can open up people's minds? To see that the reality that they live in is just a small part of the reality that is. But, I said, "Don't do it. It will destroy your career. These drugs are illegal." And they said, "Thank you very much for your opinion.
(06:39) We'll try it anyway." They got permission to do a study of MDMA, also known as ecstasy or molly, for trauma. And it worked out pretty well. Able to collect a large amount of money to do a very large and extremely expensive study. Lots of different sites around the US, one in Israel, when in Canada.
(07:03) So let me tell you how to study is set up. After all the preparation, you have a whole day of taking ecstasy while you lie on a bed with two therapists in your room for eight hours. What we see in the people who get the drug is amazing. People are able to go to places they have never felt safe to go. This is not a picnic.
(07:31) They see the horrible things that's happened to them. But MDMA allows people to see themselves with compassion. All these measures we have about self-perception and self-awareness just shoot up. And rather than blaming themselves, they're able to say, yes, this what happened to me, but it's over.
(07:56) Part of what has kept me so busy all these years is how can we find a treatment that allows the basic sense of defectiveness and self-loathing to be controlled. And now it looks like we have found something that causes a very substantial drop in PTSD. Probably more than just about anything else we have studied.
(08:22) But what's important here is that one size doesn't fit all. Different people need very different things. What worked for my last patient very well may not work for you. Everything is an experiment in life. And healing from trauma is an experiment. (serene music)


It’s increasingly common for someone to be diagnosed with a condition such as ADHD or autism as an adult. A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers.

It's normal to wonder how you will ever heal after experiencing a personal trauma or a serious setback in your life. The truth is, life isn’t always fair.

For most of us, a personal crisis can happen at any time, each one rocking your stability personally or professionally. Regardless of whether it’s atraumaticexperience, crisis, or a significant setback, healing takes time and requires consistent, and hopeful effort.

1. Make sure you are safe:Safety and health can both feel threatened in any traumatic setback. This can be your physical safety, but also can include your emotional integrity, sense of relational security or even maintaining your health. Establishing safety for yourself is a must when it comes to healing from a crisis.

2. Cope with the initial after-effects:In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, recognize that things have changed and so will your routine for a while. Make sure to prioritize the most important things you need to do, and use your energy toward them. Everything else can wait for a moment. Direct your resources towards the things you most need to handle so you preserve your energy.

Healing from trauma and setbacks takes time. By reserving some of your energy, you will have more to give to your healing process in the future.

3. Manage youranxiety:It’s normal for anxiety to be part of the landscape as you enter this new territory. While it’s normal, you want to keep an eye out for signs that your anxiety is getting out of control.

Managing anxiety in a crisis requires being honest with yourself about how helpful or hurtful your anxiety is. If anxiety is getting in your way of functioning, this could be a sign that it’s time to see a therapist or your doctor.

4. Grieve without getting stuck:Loss is always part of a crisis, trauma, or setback, and it is normal and important to grieve. Be gentle with yourself and allow space to express your feelings—whatever they are. Crying can be cathartic, and good for you. No matter how you feel, make sure to treat yourself with compassion as you absorb your new reality.

5. Beware of "if only" and second-guessing yourself and others.Second-guessing your every move is a gateway to the quicksand offantasy. Wishing for a different reality or a different outcome or situation is a normal human reaction to an unwanted situation. That said, hanging out too long in this mindset can significantly hold you back from moving forward.

No amount of wishing will change what has happened in the past, and spending time dwelling in alternative realities can entrap you. The only place you can effect change, and take control, is within the reality of your new situation. Embrace the choices you have rather than the ones you wish you had.

6. Engage support:Lean into the support system you have, and surround yourself with positive, compassionate people as much as possible. Do your best to avoid people who are negative or judgmental.Researchshows that few things facilitate healing from trauma more than social support. Don’t let your feelings ofshame, pride, orfearstop you from getting the support you need. You do not have to do this alone, and help is available if you are willing to look.

7. Beware of shame:Traumatic experiences commonly produce feelings of shame, anxiety, and a sense of failure. Seldom does one escape traumatic experiences without also coming into contact with feelings of doubt or self-questioning.

It’s also tempting to try and resist the sheer magnitude of your feelings ofgrief, anxiety, shame, and evenhumiliation. But avoiding your feelings is one sure way to give them power.

One of your first challenges as you work on healing is to resist letting such feelings define who you are in this moment. Healing is an internal process, but it is dramatically aided by the help and support of trusted people in your life. Push through your shame by allowing people to support you. This is a vital element to bouncing back and getting on with your life.

8. Remember you can handle this:When the unexpected happens—because it could happen to any of us—resist the urge to fall intocatastrophic thinking. It’s normal to look through the rearview mirror and see all that you could have done, but this will only trap you in the past.

As you work on accepting your new reality, remind yourself thatyou can handle it.You can. Yes, it will be a process, and yes, it will be uncomfortable, and yes it will take time. But you can do this, and you will.

Healing from a crisis takes time and effort. There will be times you feel crippled by the weight of the change, and times you feel strong and positive. Be gentle with yourself, and notice your progress as you heal.

This will help ensure you maintain agrowth mindset. Just like broken bones heal stronger than before a break, we too grow stronger from weathering adversity.

When we stretch bravely past the point of vulnerability, we buildresilience. And it is this resilience that helps us weather adversity, and truly heal.

It’s increasingly common for someone to be diagnosed with a condition such as ADHD or autism as an adult. A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers.


Traumadescribes your emotional response to an experience that makes you feel threatened, afraid, and powerless.

There’s no set threshold of what harm is “bad enough” to cause trauma. A traumatic event could involve a single brush with death, like a car crash. But traumatic events can also becomplex, or ongoing and repeated over time, likeneglectorabuse.

Since threats can involve physical or psychological harm, trauma doesn’t always leave you with visible injuries. But it can still linger long-term, aspost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Trauma can challenge your ideas of how the world works and who you are as a person. This disruption can have a ripple effect on all corners of your life, from your plans for the future to yourphysical healthand relationship with your own body.

Healing from such a profound change often takes a long time, and trauma recovery isn’t always pretty, or linear. Your journey may involve obstacles, detours, and delays, along with setbacks and lost ground. You may have no idea where you’re going or how to get there — but that’s OK.

Just as trauma can take many different forms, trauma recovery take a multitude of paths. There’s no official roadmap, but keeping these 7 considerations in mind may prove helpful along your way.

Trauma isn’t something you can just “get over” with a snap of your fingers. Recovery, as a general rule, involves a number of tasks to work through, and you can’t really skip any of these.

According to theExtended Transformational Model, trauma recovery happens in five stages:

Your recovery journey may not follow these steps exactly. These steps offer more of a rough framework than a pattern you need to trace precisely.

Othermodels of trauma recoverymay divide the journey into a different number of stages, or steps. The overall arc tends to remain the same, though.

You may find it comforting to read stories about other people who experienced similar traumatic events.

And certainly, recovery narratives can offer some inspiration and help you feel less alone. That said, try to avoid the temptation to use someone else’s story as a measuring stick to judge your own journey.

Maybe you:

It’s important to keep in mind, though, that your journey is yours alone.

Even if someone faced an identical trauma, they still likely had different experiences before the trauma and found themselves in a different environment afterwards.

To put it another way, it’s not a fair race if the competitors run completely different courses.

The only accurate way to track your own recovery? Consider where you started from. And remember, another person’s success doesn’t erase your progress.

Trauma doesn’t happen in a vacuum, and neither does healing.

Say you’vesurvived a sexual assault. A range of factors, like your gender, age, ethnic background, sexual orientation, and religion, can influence how you respond to that trauma. Trauma care programs should always take those parts of your identity into account.

According to a2014 Canadian study, Indigenous survivors of sexual assault benefited from culture-informed care that incorporated traditional healing approaches.

These culture-informed care approaches acknowledgedthe effects of colonization and racismon their current traumas. It also made use of spiritual and communal strengths that mainstream mental health care neglected to incorporate.

Healing from trauma can be a complex process, particularly for Veterans. In addition to seeking out help from a qualified mental health professional, Veterans and their caregivers may find it helpful to explore how other elements of health, such as nutrition, fitness, and social wellness play a role in supporting mental health.

Take a look at these resources:

Post-traumatic growthdescribes any positive changes in your life that stem from trauma recovery.

It’s the recovery process that leads to improvement, not the trauma itself. In other words, you can become strongerin spite ofthat pain and hurt, not because of it.

Know, too, that,post-traumatic growthisn’t all or nothing. Many people experience a mix of growth and challenges. You may find, for example, that recovery leaves you with more gratitude for thesmall pleasures in life— but also more vulnerable than before.

Society, as a whole, doesn’t always have patience with the healing process. During your recovery journey, you may encounter people who tell you to “move on” from your trauma or “just get over it already” and return to the status quo. Of course, this advice often better serves their needs than yours.

Trauma often proves both physically and emotionally draining, and you may need more rest during recovery than you think. It’s always OK to take naps, relax with a nostalgic TV show or book, or simply sit quietly when you need a break.

More of a fighter than a feeler? You might think ofself-careas an act of spite against the outside forces that tried to hurt you. In short, you’re taking direct action to protect your body and soul from any future harm.

Sometimes, pleasure can offer a victory in itself.

For many people, social support makes up a vital part of recovery from trauma. Many trauma survivors have found that bonds with family, romantic partners, and friends deepen as they begin the vulnerable process of recovery.

That said, you may not feel safe disclosing your trauma to everyone in your social circle if someone in your community hurt you. If that’s the case for you, connecting with a peer support group could be a good option. In a support group, people who share similar traumas work to help each other toward recovery and healing.

Support groups are typically free and confidential. But if you want additional discretion, you can join support groups online, from the privacy of your home.

Recovery from trauma can take a lot of time and hard work, but it’s absolutely possible.

Keep in mind, though, that recovery does tend to be a gradual process. Having patience with yourself, not to mention plenty ofself-compassion, can make a big difference.

And always remember, you don’t have to make your journey alone. Loved ones and other survivors can provide emotional support, while therapists can offer more professional guidance.

Through proper therapy, self-care and more, there is a path forward

Think of your mind as a sponge. Whether it’s good or bad moments, our brains can hold onto a lot. That’s why emotional trauma can stick with us long after a traumatizing event has passed.

Sure, we’ve all had bad — or downright embarrassing — moments that stick with us. Maybe it’s that time you spilled coffee on your way to work or when youjustmissed your flight that still keeps you up at night.

But trauma is more than that. Trauma is a result of emotionally painful or abusive experiences, and it ranges from something like a physical accident to emotional abuse. The spectrum of what can generate a traumatic response is quite wide, and so the process of healing can look different for everyone.

Registered psychotherapistNatacha Duke, MA, RP,explains the different types of trauma, how they can affect you and what the steps are for healing.

Trauma is an emotional response that lasts long after an event occurs that causes significant mental and physical stress. Just like a physical scar from a deep cut takes time to heal, recovery from trauma is possible with time and treatment. It’s important to remember that ignoring or avoiding symptoms of trauma isn’t a healthy coping response (in fact, avoiding them can make things worse — more on that later).

When you go through a traumatic event, your mind sometimes remembers how it felt and keeps that trauma response “at the ready.” But Duke also points out, “Some people can’t recall traumatic events for many years.”

In general, trauma affects twoparts of your brain:

This is why certain experiences — or triggers — can set off a traumatic memory and put you in that fight or flight mode, even though there’s norealdanger happening. For example, the sound of an overhead plane can take a veteran withPTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder)back to the fear they felt on the battlefield. Or a loud crack of thunder may cause ahurricane survivorto feel the same intense anxiety they felt at the time of that traumatic experience.

So even though it happened in the past,unresolved trauma can affect your present— causing things like panic attacks, depression or an inability to go on with normal routines. In some cases, you may also develop complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD), which happens due to prolonged or repeated trauma over time.

So, how do you recognize the painful moments while also healing the emotional scars left behind? The first step is to give your feeling a name: trauma. It’s not just a small setback that you can shake off or need to feel ashamed about — it’s something that becomes a part of your story.

The trauma you experience doesn’t have to look a certain way for it to be valid.

According to Duke, trauma can sometimes be understood as big “T” and little “t” trauma. The difference between these two isn’t really a matter of severity (it’s not a competition over which trauma is worse), but rather how it affects your mind.

Big “T” trauma is likely the first thing you think of when you think of trauma: Large, bombastic moments that can alter your physical and mental well-being. “The big ‘T’ trauma would be like a mass trauma and it would be a circumstance that most people, no matter who they are, would find traumatic,” explains Duke. “So, it could be anything that causes emotional distress or that is out of the ordinary.”

Advertisement

Some examples of big “T” trauma are:

Little “t” trauma is complex in a different way — it may not affect everyone the same. In some cases, the little “t” trauma can be harder to recognize or define.

Examples of little “t” trauma include:

“What is traumatic to one person really might not phase someone else,” Duke notes. “Bullying is a good example of little ‘t’ trauma. Some people experienced bullying as a child and aren’t very fazed by it, whereas others can really relive being bullied as though it just happened.”

Whether it’s big “T” or little “t,” trauma can come from many different sources.

Here are some types of trauma and the effects they have:

Childhood traumacan stem from physical abuse,verbal abuseor neglect that you experience when you were young. But there are also other things that could fall under this umbrella, like witnessing abuse, being in an accident at a young age or growing up in a stressful home environment.

“In general, when trauma happens at an earlier age, it tends to have more of an impact,” states Duke. Children who experience trauma under the age of 8 are especially vulnerable. If you experience childhood trauma, it’s likely to affect you into your adult years. But it’s possible to address the trauma while you’re still young — if the warning signs are noticed in time.

“The way that childhood trauma tends to manifest into adulthood is a profound sense of shame and guilt,” Duke notes.

Along with that, childhood trauma may also lead to:

Childhood trauma can also overlap with parental trauma — when you undergo abuse from a caregiver. “If the abuse happens by a primary caregiver, that tends to have a more profound effect than if it happened with a stranger, or with a more extended family member,” Duke adds.

Sexual assaultis likely the first type of sexual trauma that comes to mind. Additionally, any exposure to sexually inappropriate, harmful or violent behavior can cause sexual trauma. Sexual trauma frequently occurs when you don’t (or can’t)give informed consentto a sexual act.

As with other forms of trauma, it’s common forsexual trauma to cause PTSD, which can manifest in your life as nightmares, anxiety-boosting triggers and memory loss. According to Duke, your experience (and healing process) with sexual trauma will vary depending on whether it was a single event or ongoing, as well as your age.

“I’ve seen people who experience flashbacks for a few months, while others experience flashbacks for several years later,” she adds. “It just really depends on so many different variables.”

Sexual trauma can also stay with you in a very physical sense. “Someone may have difficulty with going to the doctor’s office, seeing a gynecologist or having those kinds of exams done,” Duke continues.

Another note about sexual trauma is that in some cases, it can overlap with childhood trauma. This can lead to a tendency for certain behaviors to appear later in life such as:

Unhealthy relationshipscan also cause trauma, especially if therelationship is abusive(either physical oremotional abuse).

Relationship trauma can also result from romantic relationships where a significant other didn’t respect your boundaries or an on-and-off relationship that left you feeling drained and confused.

“For example, someone could be involved in a relationship where the dynamic is very manipulative,” explains Duke. “It could also be due to things likegaslightingor a betrayal of trust.”

“The effects of relationship traumaaren’t going to be clear right away,” she says. “But they can affect your sense of self-worth and what you feel you deserve in future romantic partners.

“Some people respond to relationship trauma by really isolating themselves from other relationships. Others have the opposite reaction, which is to jump from relationship to relationship and never want to be — or cannot be — alone.”

Community is one of the main ways we connect with others — both in childhood and in adulthood. And religious groups are a common place to find community. But similar to relationship trauma, trauma can occur if people you once trusted (such as your church community) become manipulative, toxic or abusive. In a religious setting, a certain belief system can be used as a form of shaming as well.

“Religious trauma can come from wanting to leave a certain set of beliefs, practices or a religious figure or group that is making the person feel manipulated or controlled in some way,” Duke explains.

Trauma like this can be especially complicated because it affects who you trust and confide in. If you’re someone who survived the trauma of a cult or a toxic religious setting, you may be hesitant to connect with others and find a new community.

“You may also have difficulty distinguishing what you can and cannot believe in,” says Duke. “Some people may have a lot of fear around death or being punished, especially if that’s been the message that they’ve received throughout their life.”

There are tools available that can help you process your trauma, find peace and not let it take over your life. This doesn’t mean you can “just get over” your trauma. Instead, it means facing it head-on, being kind to yourself and forging a new path.

Duke explains some steps you can take to heal from trauma:

Maybe you’re already aware of your trauma and want to take the next step. Or maybe you’re having trouble figuring out the cause of the trauma that’s manifesting in your everyday life. In both cases, atrauma-informedtherapist will be your best ally in the healing process.

“The most important step is to establish a really safetherapeutic alliancebefore you open up about all the details of your trauma,” advises Duke. This often means that your therapist should let you establish certain boundaries, whether that’s topics of conversation or certain trigger words.

It’s also important that your therapist be informed not only on how to build trust, but also on what tools can help you work through your trauma safely and efficiently.

For example, many trauma-informed therapists may recommendeye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)therapy as a way to address painful memories. “But you really want to ensure that you find someone who is trained in EMDR because it’s quite a specific type of therapy,” stresses Duke.

It’s especially hard when a trauma response hits you when you don’t expect it. You may be at the grocery store or getting gas, and suddenly, a trigger catches you off guard and you feel an immense sense of danger or dread. To help prevent such a reaction, it’s important to learn about your own trauma triggers and what might set them off. This will help you better understand yourself and the healthy boundaries you may need to set.

If your brain is constantly bombarded by horrible memories, bothmeditationandmindfulnesscan be a healing practice — but Duke recommends not jumping into them without training wheels. An open or freestyle of meditation might be too overwhelming at first. She recommends instead starting with a guided meditation to help ease you into the practice.

Try an app or a YouTube video that’ll guide your thoughts to a focal point. Even a collection of music that keeps you calm and grounded can serve as a useful meditation guide.

In your head, there may be two actors running the show: You and your trauma. So, if your trauma causes you to be unkind or harmful to yourself, it’s important to work against it. That’s whyself-carecan be an empowering way to make time for yourself — your inner child or simply your past self — who has endured the trauma.

Activities likeyogaorexercisehave been shown to be beneficial in healing from (or at least alleviating) the effects of trauma. Taking on hobbies you’re interested in, such as painting, boxing, a dance class or just going for daily walks, can also be part of self-care. It’s not a cure-all, but simply something — anything — that brings joy into your life and makes you feel likeyoucan be a source of healing.

And if the response to trauma is greatly impacting your daily life — or that of someone you know — reach out to a mental health expert or connect with a resource or support group for help, such as:

Guided meditation makes use of verbal cues to help us remain focused on the meditation’s intention. Guided meditation can be particularly beneficial for beginners or for anyone learning a meditation style for the first time. ‘Listening’ to a meditation versus ‘doing’ the meditation can also be relaxing. Especially, for those of us who have yet to cultivate the skill of simply being.

Anyone can learn how to lead a guided meditation with compassion and understanding. After all, a meditation guide need not be a guru, but can be any fellow practitioner who has adequate training on how to guide people in a safe and caring manner.

After spending over 2 years living as a Buddhist monk, seeing first-hand the benefits of daily meditation, I was inspired to leave the monastery to share meditation as widely as possible. Although I teach mindfulness and meditation, as just one person, I can only reach so many others. But by teaching people how to lead a guided meditation, so many more are able to benefit from this profound practice.

Learning how to lead mindfulness meditation begins with deepening your personal practice. As you continue to meditate and share your practice with others, the following tips can help you grow as a meditation guide.

Yoga teachers, counselors, therapists, school teachers, parents, and others may be curious about how to lead a guided meditation, but uninterested in becoming a meditation teacher. That is perfectly okay and quite understandable. For example, it might benefit a corporate manager to lead a quick, grounding meditation at the start of a meeting. The skills required to guide meditation are not the same as that which we expect of our mindfulness teachers.

Teaching meditation is an advanced skillset which includes preparing people to practice on their own, to become their own guides. Although this often includes learning how to lead a meditation session, teachers also have an understanding of the history and foundational principles of mindfulness, training on how to ethically and effectively present inner methods of self-discovery, training on how to prevent and overcome adverse experiences, and an extraordinary depth of practice.

A meditation guide is not comprehensively educating others on a complete practice and path. They are simply inviting others to join them in a one-time experience. Of course, the more training a meditation guide has, the more those who meditate with them can benefit from their instruction.

Anyone can read a guided meditation script. However, if this person has not put true effort into understanding how to lead a meditation, it shows. Guiding meditation asks for more than a simple reading of words on a piece of paper. The best meditation guides are mindful and aware, kind and compassionate. What’s more, they have training in how to hold space and help participants in the practice feel supported and safe.

When meditation is guided by a trained facilitator, the benefits to participants increase. The best meditation guides know this is not a performance in which they are the point of focus. They know when a few words of support are necessary, and when and how to hold space for silence. They understand that the experience of the meditator is their own, and that their selfless guidance supports that unfolding experience.

The following 10 steps are not a replacement for formal training on how to lead a meditation class, but can get you started in the right direction. May they help you guide mindfulness practices with more confidence and ease, skill and compassion.

Turning our gaze inward in meditation is not always a comfortable task. A skilled meditation guide recognizes this and does their best to create a sense of support, in which participants feel safe practicing presence with discomfort, pain and challenge.

Creating a safe space includes embodying mindfulness and awareness as a guide, setting clear expectations, and guiding with inclusive, trauma-sensitive language. Holding a safe space as a meditation guide also entails choosing an appropriate meditation for the audience.

As a meditation guide, the best possible outcome is if those who join you in practice feel inspired to come back. After all, the benefits of meditation increase with our consistent participation. One way to help people view their session as successful is to set reasonable expectations before you even begin.

People often feel they have failed at meditation if they felt distracted, or even if they had any thoughts! Others may feel mindfulness meditation is supposed to put us into a state of deep relaxation or calm. This is nice, but presence and not one particular feeling, is the goal. Setting expectations by addressing these and others myths can help keep self-criticism and disappointment at bay.

As a meditation guide, it’s important that the practice you share with others is one you are familiar with. People respond to our energy and presence just as much as they respond to our words. So, the more you embody the words you are sharing, the better they will land.

There’s no need to wait for perfection or all-pervading wisdom before you lead a meditation. But, it’s important to have a relationship to the material that is rooted in repeated practice. Being prepared also entails includes beginning on time, having a plan for the session, and knowing where to refer someone if questions arise that you cannot answer.

Whether or not you are using a meditation script, every meditation has an intention. Getting clear on what this intention is will not only help those you are leading, but will also help you.

A clear intention sets the boundaries of the practice. If the intention is mindfulness of breath, for example, inviting participants to notice bird sounds, although potentially pleasant, takes the group out of the meditation.

There’s nothing wrong with using a script, a few notes, or a bullet pointed list to help you stay focused as you guide meditation. Many people learning how to lead a guided meditation find just knowing they are there is a helpful confidence booster, even if they never end up looking at them.

If you are using a script, you may need to make some edits to say things in your own voice, in a way that feels authentic to you. And with or without a script, just be you! The best meditation guides don’t alter their persona or put on a ‘meditation voice’ when guiding meditations, they are confident in being themselves. This too, is how we share the practice.

You may be very skilled at writing beautiful meditations, or you may have a lot to say, but it’s helpful to remember that leading meditation is not about you. Those who best understand how to lead a meditation session know the value of letting the participants have their own experience. This means cueing only when necessary, and otherwise allowing for silence.

As a meditation guide, you’ll need to balance self-awareness with awareness of the room. In your meditators, you may notice sleepiness, restlessness or intense focus. Be mindful of your reactivity to what you might label as boredom, distraction, trying too hard or not hard enough. Allow space for everyone to have their own experience, and understand what you bring to yours, too.

Learning how to lead a meditation class may also include training in how to facilitate a post-meditation discussion. Meditation guides who are not trained facilitators may want to simply hold space for practitioners to contemplate their meditation experience. You might also prompt people to journal about any insights or questions that arose.

As a meditation guide, and even as a mindfulness teacher, it’s impossible to control the outcome of any given meditation session. There may be participants who have adverse experiences, or who have questions you simply cannot answer.

As a meditation guide, it’s good practice to have resources on hand that you can share with others. This may include information on where participants can go to learn more about mindfulness and meditation. It may include a list of recommended meditation teachers, counselors or therapists. For the few participants who may have an adverse experience that extends beyond the meditation session, talking to someone atCheetah Housemay be beneficial.

Learning how to lead guided meditations is more accessible than ever, especially with the wealth of online resources available at Mindfulness Exercises.

In addition, consider joining a guided meditation group as a participant. Learn by watching others, and in the process, deepen your practice and understanding.

Perhaps the biggest challenge when it comes to leading guided meditations is the inner critic that says we’re not ready. We can overcome this self-doubt with ongoing meditation practice and training in how to guide meditations. We also develop our sense of worthiness by doing worthy things, even before we think we are ready.

The good news is, guiding meditation does not depend on our perfection, righteousness or  enlightenment. Anyone who genuinely wants to help others, anyone for whom meditation has been a help, can invite others to practice alongside them.

Download a script of your favorite practice, and with honesty and integrity, gather up your closest friends and ask if you can share it with them. You’ll be well on your way to becoming a meditation guide.

What should I do if someone I know is suicidal?


Mayo Clinic offers appointments in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota and at Mayo Clinic Health System locations.

Hopelessness may lead you to think about suicide. Learn how to stay safe, get through a crisis and find treatment.

When life does not seem worth living anymore, it may seem that the only way to find relief is through suicide. When you're feeling this way, it may be hard to believe that you have other options.

Take a moment to step back and separate your emotions from your actions. When you feel depressed and think there's no hope, it's much harder to make reasonable decisions. But problems that bring on suicidal feelings can be treated.

It may not be easy, and you might not feel better overnight. Eventually, though, the sense of hopelessness — and thoughts of taking your life — will lift.

If you think you may hurt yourself or take your life, get help right away by taking one of these actions:

Do not try to manage suicidal thoughts or behavior on your own. You need professional help and support to overcome the problems linked to thoughts about taking your life.

Your doctor or mental health professional can help you learn different ways to cope and solve problems. Consider talking about these coping strategies with people who know you well, such as family members or trusted friends.

You may be urged to do things you do not feel like doing, such as talking with friends when you'd rather stay in your bedroom all day. It will get easier to do these things as they become habits.

Create a written plan of action or a "safety plan" with your mental health professional. You can refer to this plan when you're thinking about suicide or are in a crisis. A safety plan includes what makes you think about suicide and how you can cope with those thoughts. Learn to spot your warning signs early, so you can put your plan into action.

Your plan is a checklist of activities and actions you promise to do to stay safe when you have thoughts of suicide, such as:

Even if the immediate crisis passes, see a doctor or mental health professional. This will help you get the right treatment for suicidal thoughts and depression so that you do not always have to be in crisis mode.

As part of your plan, take these steps:

The hopelessness you feel as you consider suicide may be the side effect of a very hard situation or an illness that can be treated. This emotion can be so overpowering that it clouds your judgment and leads you to believe that taking your life is the best, or only, option. But with help, you can change how you think about your situation:

By getting proper treatment and using effective coping strategies, you can learn to manage or rid yourself of suicidal thoughts and create a more satisfying life.

One of your close friends has been struggling lately. When you messaged to see how they’re doing, they replied: “I can’t stand myself. I spend all day thinking about the mistakes I’ve made. The world would be better off without me. At least I wouldn’t feel so terrible anymore.”

No, they didn’t come right out and say, “I’m thinking aboutsuicide.” Still, the underlying meaning of their words alarms you.

You care about your friend and want to offer reassurance, but you’ve never had thoughts of dying yourself, and you haveno idea what to say.

First, know they might feel scared, too. Even people who have suicidal thoughts often fear those thoughts. People thinking of suicide don’t necessarily have a clear plan or specific timeline. They simply want a way to stop pain that seems unbearable and impossible to overcome.

It’s normal to feel helpless when a friend mentions suicide, however indirectly, but there’s a lot you can do to help. In fact, your compassion and support could make all the difference.

Suicidal thoughtsaren’t uncommon.

In 2018, more than10 million Americanshad serious thoughts of suicide.

These thoughts often arise in response to stressful or challenging life situations, including physical or mental health issues,trauma, abuse,loneliness, and isolation.

Not everyone who has thoughts of suicide will make an attempt, but suicide remains the second leading cause of death among Americans ages 10–34, according to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Itisa significant health crisis — and apreventableone.

The steps below can help you support your friend through a moment of crisis.

It’s a common myth that people talk about suicide to get attention. This is not the case for most people, so it’s always best (and safest) to assume your friend means what they say.

Brushing off their mention of suicide invalidates their distress. They may feel reluctant to share their thoughts with anyone else or reach out for professional support.

Instead, they might continue carrying their pain in silence, believing things will never improve.

People often talk about suicide in vague or unclear ways.

Your friend could say things that reflect a sense of shame, hopelessness, or failure. They may not say, “I want to die,” or “I want to kill myself.” Instead, they might say:

Their mood and actions can also show some signs.

You might notice they:

These signs don’t always mean your friend is thinking about suicide, but it never hurts to have a conversation when their actions or language concern you.

You might say: “I feel a little worried about you because… (mention a few things you’ve noticed). How can I offer support?”

You can get a better idea of your friend’s immediate risk by asking a few important questions.

Not everyone who thinks about dying has a plan or the means and intent to carry out their plan. Someone who says yes to all of these questions and has a clear timeframe for dying, however, needsimmediate support(more on this in a moment).

When someone you love mentions suicide, you might believe avoiding the subject entirely and encouraging them to think about brighter things will help them feel better.

It’s normal to feel scared or uncertain of the best response, but shying away from the subject won’t help.

Your friend might take your avoidance as a sign you aren’t comfortable talking about suicide. They might also get the message you don’t appreciate the depth of their pain, even when that’s not the case. In either case, they might stop confiding in you.

The idea that discussing suicide will make someone more likely to act on suicidal thoughts isjust another myth. People who have the chance to open up about their thoughts and share their pain with anempathic listeneroften feel some relief from the most overwhelming feelings of distress.

When talking to someone who’s having thoughts of suicide, what you say really matters.

You don’t want to deny their distress or ask things like, “How could you possibly feel that way?” or “Why would you want to die? You have so much to live for.”

Trying to solve problems for them usually won’t help, either — what might seem like a small fix to you can seem insurmountable to someone in acrisis.

To validate their feelings and offer hope at the same time, try:

If your friend has thoughts of suicide but no plan or immediate risk, they may feel a little better after sharing their distress.

This doesn’t mean they’re completely fine. They may continue to deal with suicidal thoughts until they get help addressing the underlying concern.

Staying in touch with your friend can remind them you still care, even after the crisis has passed.

Check in on how they’re feeling by saying things like:

You can also support them by encouraging them to talk to a therapist aboutlingering or recurring suicidal thoughts.

Just remember you can’t force them to go to therapy, no matter how deeply you believe it would help.

It can feel pretty upsetting to watch someone struggle alone, but telling them what to do may not work.

These suggestions show your friend you care while gently reminding them of your limits. You probably can’t offer any real solutions to their distress, buttherapists are trained to support and help peoplehaving thoughts of suicide.

If your friend seems reluctant, try offering to help themfind a therapistor take them to their first appointment.

Someone with an immediate suicide risk may need more help than you can provide.

If your friend has a plan for suicide, access to what they’d need to carry it out, and a specific timeframe, you’ll want to support them by getting professional help right away.

That said, the strategies below can help you offer support while you wait for professional help.

Intense emotional turmoil can make it tough to see things from a rational viewpoint, and people overwhelmed by their pain often see situations as worse than they actually are.

Thisdistorted perspectivecan contribute to suicidal thoughts and even make suicide seem like the only real option.

Whilegrounding techniquesmay not work for everyone, they can sometimes help people in the grip of distress regain some clarity and refocus on what’s actually happening in the present.

These techniques often incorporate the five senses to help people reconnect to their physical environments.

Try these simple exercises together:

Your friend may have created a safety plan with the help of a counselor if they’ve had thoughts of suicide before. These plans are simple and brief, and generally include things like:

If they don’t have a safety plan, they may not feel up to creating one while actively in distress. If they do want to try, your assistance can make the task a little easier.

Help your friend stay safe by sticking close or staying on the phone.

If they don’t feel up to talking, you can try walking, watching a distracting movie or TV show, or even simply sitting together.

Reassure them you’ll stay until someone else arrives, and help them connect with other friends or family members.

Call emergency services right away if they:

There may come a time when you feel unable to continue supporting your friend.

You can only do so much to help on your own. If you begin feeling stressed, overwhelmed, or scared, it may be time to talk to other people in their life, like a parent or romantic partner.

Encourage them to connect with trusted friends, family members, healthcare providers, and others who can offer compassionate support.

Supporting a friendexperiencing suicidal thoughts isn’t always easy. You can’t always provide the support they need, so it’s important to recognize when the crisis has passed the point where you can safely handle it alone.

There are several ways you can offer to help your friend:

When crisis lines don’t seem to help:

If you believe your friend is in real danger, don’t hesitate to call 911 or drive them to the emergency room. They may get upset in the moment, but your action can help them stay safe.

Thoughts of suicide, even if they seem vague, should always be taken seriously.

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to helping a friend who’s thinking about suicide, but you can never go wrong by showing compassion and support.

When someone you know talks about taking their own life, you might not know what to do. Learn warning signs, what questions to ask and how to get help.

When someone you know talks about taking their own life or says things that sound like a suicide plan, it can be very upsetting. You may not know whether to take the talk of suicide seriously. You also may wonder whether you could make the situation worse by getting involved. Taking action is always the best choice. Here's what to do.

The first step is to find out whether the person is in danger of acting on feelings about suicide. Be sensitive, but ask direct questions, such as:

Asking about thoughts or feelings about suicide will not push a person into suicide. In fact, giving someone a chance to talk about feelings may reduce the person's risk of acting on those feelings.

When a loved one or friend is thinking about suicide, they may:

If a friend or loved one talks or behaves in a way that makes you believe the person might try suicide, do not try to handle the situation alone. Instead:

Female 1:I have my ups and downs just like anybody else.

Male 1:Maybe more than anybody else.

Female 2:I can be hard to figure out

Male 2:and I like my privacy.

Male 3:I don't want you looking over my shoulder all the time.

Female 3:But you know your kid better than anybody else and if you think he's acting different than usual,

Male 1:acting really down, crying all the time for no good reason

Female 2:or getting really mad,

Female 1:not able to sleep or sleeping too much,

Male 3:shutting their friends out or giving their stuff away,

Female 2:acting reckless, drinking, using drugs, staying out late,

Male 2:suddenly not doing stuff they used to love

Female 3:or doing stuff that's just not like him,

Male 1:it might be nothing to worry about. It might just be high school

Female 1:or it might be something more. He might be depressed.

Female 3:Not just feeling down, really depressed.

Male 2:It might be that your kid is thinking about killing himself.

Male 3:It happens more than you think, more than it should.

Female 3:And people say "I had no idea."

Male 1:"I thought it was just a phase he was going through."

Female 1:"I never thought she'd do it."

Male 2:"I wish he'd come to me."

Female 2:"I wish he had said something."

Male 3:"I wish I'd said something."

Female 3:when it's too late. So if you think your kids acting different, if she seems like a different person, say something.

Male 1:Say "What's wrong? How can I help?"

Female 2:and ask him straight out, "Are you thinking about killing yourself?"

Female 1:It doesn't hurt to ask. In fact, it helps.

Male 3:When people are thinking about killing themselves, they want somebody to ask.

Male 2:They want somebody to care.

Female 2:Maybe you're afraid you'll make it worse if you ask. Like you'll put the idea in their head.

Male 3:Believe me, it doesn't work that way.

Female 1:It doesn't hurt to ask.

Female 3:In fact, the best way to keep a teenager from killing herself is to ask, "Are you thinking about killing yourself?"

Male 1:And what if they say "yes"

Female 2:or "maybe"

Male 2:or "sometimes?"

Female 3:Well, here's what youdon'tsay,

Male 3:"That's crazy."

Female 2:"Don't be such a drama queen."

Male 3:"You're making too much of this."

Female 1:"That boy's not worth killing yourself over."

Female 3:"It's not going to solve anything."

Male 1:"You're just trying to get attention."

Male 2:"You're not going to kill yourself."

Male 3:What youdosay is

Female 2:"I'm sorry you're feeling so bad."

Female 1:"How can I help?"

Female 3:"We'll get through this together."

Male 1:"Let's keep you safe."

Male 2:A lot of people think about killing themselves, adults and kids.

Male 3:Most of them never tried but some of them do, so if your kid says,

Female 2:"I'd be better off dead."

Female 3:"I can't live with this."

Male 3:"I'm gonna kill myself."

Male 2:take her seriously. Find someone she can talk to about it. Someone who knows how to help.

Female 2:Sometimes kids want to kill themselves because something happened--a breakup, a failure,

Female 1:but sometimes it goes deeper and it's not going to go away by itself.

Female 3:Get some help. Talk to your doctor,

Male 2:or a counselor at school,

Male 1:or your minister,

Male 3:but don't just let it drop,

Female 1:and make sure that your kid always has someone to turn to. Someone he trusts.

Female 3:Make a list together. Write down three, four, five names

Male 1:and put a suicide hotline number on there, too.

Male 3:Have him keep that list in his wallet so he always knows where to turn.

Female 3:Make sure your home is safe.

Female 2:If you have pills she could use to hurt herself, lock them up.

Male 2:If you have a gun, don't just lock it up. Get it out of the house, the bullets too.

Male 1:And one more thing, if you think your kid might be about to hurt himself, don't leave him alone.

Female 1:Take him to the emergency room.

Male 3:Call 9-1-1 if you have to.

Male 1:We all have our ups and downs but sometimes it's more than that.

Female 3:If you think something's wrong, the only way to find out is to ask.

Female 2:Ask straight-out, "Are you thinking about killing yourself?"

Male 2:Don't wait until you're sure. Trust your gut.

Male 3:Because it never hurts to ask

Female 1:and it can make a big difference,

Female 2:all the difference

Female 3:in your kid's life.

If you're a teenager who's worried that a friend or classmate may be thinking about suicide, take action:

It may be hard to tell whether a friend or classmate is thinking about suicide. You may be afraid to take action and be wrong. If someone's behavior or talk makes you think the person is at risk of suicide, that person may be struggling with major issues. Even if your friend or classmate is not thinking about suicide, you can help the person get to the right resources.

If a friend or loved one is thinking about suicide, professional help is needed — even if suicide is not a danger right away. Here's what you can do:

If someone talks about suicide plans or behaves in a way that suggests the person is thinking of suicide, do not play it down or ignore the situation. Many people who kill themselves have expressed the intention at some point. You may worry that you're overreacting, but the safety of your friend or loved one is most important. Do not worry about straining your relationship when someone's life is at stake.

You're not responsible for preventing a suicide. But you can take action to help the person see that other options are available to stay safe and get treatment.

[Song lyrics]

I know what it feels like to say I'm so cold. One without the other. Lost in that hole. Don't think you are all alone. You have somewhere to go. This ain't a one-person show. Let someone out there lend you a hand. Don't go through this alone.

Reach Out. Give someone a chance to help even when you are falling down, down, down. Your whole life will turn around. Reach out to somebody. Give your hand to somebody. Life is in the palm of their hands.

Reach Out. Give someone a chance to help even when you are falling down, down, down. Your whole life will turn around. Reach out to somebody. Give your hand to somebody. Life is in the palm of their hands. Reach out to them. Reach out to them. Reach out to them.

I’m feeling like I don’t want to live anymore, what should I do?



The rate of suicide is on the rise worldwide in all age categories. It affects all ethnicities, cultures, and religions.

It is bias-free.

It is a last resort, a desperate attempt to quell the never-ending and relentless pain that monopolizes your mind. It has become the only feasible way to rid yourself of the burdensome weight that has dragged you to this level of despair.

That is how I’ve felt anyway, the countless number of times I have and do fall into the darkness. And because I can empathize, take a minute to read this letter to you.

Dear You.

If you are reading this there is a small piece of you that wants to hold on.

I am so proud of youfor reaching out, even if you have done so without words. You have kindly given me a few minutes of your time, and I do appreciate that.

I want you to live.

I want you to want to live.

I won’t feed you some bullshit like it’s all going to be OK with time because it may not be, and it may not turn out as you wish, but you will never know if you don’t stick around to find out.I will instead tell you I am here with you. Let’s take this a minute at a time.

I will remind youthat although I don’t know what tomorrow will bring, I will be by your side to find out.

You are so important.

I won’t make you feel selfish by telling you to stick around for your family or friends, because I know you feel that leaving would not only end your burden, but theirs as well.

I will tell you someone loves youdespite how you feel inside. I will remind you that you are not and never will be a burden. You may not see or even hear it, but someone out there values your life; I value your life. I don’t know you, but I do care because I can empathize with your pain; I feel it myself.

You are incredibly strong.

I won’t ever tell you that you are being dramatic anddon’t really want to die.I will instead be here to listenand validate your feelings because they are as significant as you are.I am so proud of you for still staying with me.I won’t ever tell you things could be worse or that other people have it worse than you and don’t want to die.

I will acknowledge your despairand lack of hope. I will never compare your pain to another’s. It would be like observing two gunshot wounds, one in the chest and one in the leg. Yes, it is worse to get shot in the chest, but it does not take away the pain of being shot in the leg.You are beautiful.I won’t use the old adage “suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.”

I will say that your problemsmight not be temporary, but I will be with you and help you to find a coping mechanism that works for you. I will tell you suicide is simply not a solution.

I won’t shove the ideas of therapy or medication down your throat as that will not help at the moment.I will asksome of the most important words of all:How can I help?”

I will provide you with asuicide hotline(988 or text the word “HOME” to 741-741.)You are a warrior.Your track record of making it through trauma, heartbreak, and devastation is 100 percent. Despite the rocks life has thrown at you, you have emerged with scars and grit. You have proven wrong those who expected you not to make it, those who gave up on you long before you gave up on yourself.

You are amazing.

You have a purposein this life, whether you realize it at this point or not. Your book has so many chapters to be written. You are needed, your voice and your story are essential for someone, be it a stranger or a friend.

You are your own hero. You have done what you think you cannot do. You have looked death in the face, stared it down and walked away having won another battle in your war.

If you are still reading this, I am incredibly proud of youfor stopping what you were doing and giving me a few moments of your precious time. Just reading this is the beginning… you have extended your arm, you just have to unclench your fist. I implore you to keep this conversation going, be it with a hotline, a friend or family member, or even me by emailing jody_betty@hotmail.com.

You have taken the first step; let’s make it to the second together.

You are loved.

If you or someone you know needs help, visit oursuicide prevention resources.

If you need support right now, you can call, text, or chat the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988, or text HOME to 741-741 to reach the Crisis Text Line if you are in the U.S. A list of crisis centers around the world can be foundhere.

Thoughts of suicide can take many forms. No matter what you’re going through, help and support are available.

Active thoughts ofsuicideinvolve clear and specific thoughts about suicide or plans to take your own life.

But suicidal thoughts can also take a less-defined shape. Maybe you don’t have an actual plan to die, but you:

Whether they’re passive or active, persistent thoughts about suicide and death can leave you feeling overwhelmed, hopeless, and unsure where to turn for support.

Plus, talking about these thoughts can be tough. You may not know how to start sharing them with others, for one. But you might also worry about their potential responses:

What many people don’t realize is that suicidal thoughts are fairly common. In fact, over12 millionadults in the United States seriously thought about suicide in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

You can also have these thoughts even if you don’t havedepressionor any other mental health diagnosis. This is because suicidal thoughts can simply indicate you’re experiencing more sadness and pain than you know how to manage.

It’s natural to want to put a stop to pain and unhappiness, and suicidal thoughts might surface when you can’t envision a way out of your distress. But you do have options for getting support with handling these thoughts.

If you’re having thoughts of suicide, you’re not alone.

To get help right away, consider reaching out to a free and confidential crisis helpline.

Trained crisis counselors can offer:

They won’t give you advice or tell you what to do, but theycanhelp you move from a moment of crisis to a calmer frame of mind.

First, know that anyone can experience suicidal thoughts. These thoughts don’t represent a weakness, flaw, or personal failure. They’re nothing to feel guilty or ashamed of, either — no matter your situation.

If you’re considering methods of suicide or actively thinking about ending your life, these steps can help you stay safe while you work on getting longer-term support:

The feelings of pain and despair might not immediately improve, and addressing suicidal thoughts can take time and professional support. But taking the first steps toward managing these thoughts can help you get enough distance to regain some hope and explore more long-term methods of relief.

Again, suicidal thoughts don’t always mean having a specific plan to die. You might wish you were dead, for example, or frequently think about dying, even if you have no intentions of attempting suicide.

These passive suicidal thoughts are still serious, though. These tips can offer a starting place for managing them:

Even when life’s challenges and painful moments feel most overwhelming, it can help to remember you’re not alone. Opening up about how you feel may not change your situation or completely banish those thoughts, but sharing those thoughts with a loved one or therapist can make it easier to get the right kind of support.

Suicidal thoughts don’t have one single cause. They might begin for any number of reasons.

In some cases, they might be a symptom of an underlying mental health condition, like:

But not everyone with these conditions will have thoughts of suicide. You can also experience suicidal thoughtswithoutan underlying mental health condition. In fact,54 percentof people who died by suicide don’t have a diagnosed mental health condition, according to 2018 statistics from the CDC.

A family history of mental health conditions, suicidal thoughts, or suicide can make it more likely you’ll experience suicidal thoughts, too.

Experts believecertain genescould play a part in suicidal thoughts and behavior, though research is still in the early stages.

In a small2020 study, researchers also found that children with a parent who had attempted suicide tended to face more stress in life and have more difficulty regulating emotions. Both of these factors can contribute to suicidal thoughts or attempts later in life.

Other factors that might increase your chances of experiencing suicidal thoughts include:

Maybe you’ve noticed some concerning signs in a friend or loved one’s behaviors, such as:

On one hand, you might wonder if they’re thinking about suicide. On the other hand, you might worry that asking them will give them the idea, if they’re not.

But that’s just a myth.Evidencesuggests asking about suicide generally won’t increase these thoughts.

In fact, asking about suicidal thoughts can have more of a positive impact: When you bring up the topic yourself, you let them know you’re willing to listen andoffer support.

It’s possible to experience suicidal thoughts without any obvious risk factors. These feelings can intensify when someone feels guilty, unworthy, or unable to ask for help or get support. You can support a loved one talking about suicide by taking them seriously and listening with compassion.You may not know how to help, but sometimes simply being there for them can make a major difference. Keep in mind, too, that pain and emotional distress can make it much harder for them to recognize solutions that might seem obvious to you.

Coping strategies can help you manage thoughts of suicide in the moment, but they typically can’t help resolve the causes that contribute to these thoughts.

In other words, until you begin to identify and work through the concerns triggering these thoughts, they’ll likely keep coming back.

You don’t have to start this process alone. Support from a trained mental health professional can go a long way toward getting more lasting relief from these thoughts.

A therapist can offer compassionate guidance and professional support with:

Your therapist might ask questions about:

They can also recommend helpful therapy approaches, such ascognitive behavioral therapyordialectical behavior therapy.

Getting support for any health, mental health, or emotional concerns prompting suicidal thoughts can often help ease those thoughts, not to mention prevent them in the future.

When searching for a therapist, remember that finding someone you can truly open up to can go a long way toward making therapy more successful. If you can’t trust your therapist, you may not feel able to share deeply distressing thoughts, concerns, or mental health symptoms.

In rare cases, certain antidepressant medications maypose a riskofincreased suicidal thoughts, especially when you first start taking them.

If you do experience thoughts of suicide while taking an antidepressant or otherpsychotropic medication, connect with your psychiatrist or prescribing clinician right away — but keep taking the medication unless they change your dosage or prescribe a different medication.

Stopping a medication or changing your dosage without professional guidance is never a good idea, since this can make suicidal thoughts worse. It can also lead to withdrawal symptoms.

Right now, you may feel as if you have no way to escape the pain and unhappiness you feel. Remember, though, that nothing is permanent, not even the worst distress. Time, support from loved ones, and professional help can make the future seem much brighter.

Opening up to someone you trust is always a good first step. Sharing thoughts of suicide can help you realize you’re not alone, but knowing you have the support of someone you love can also make it easier to explore options for professional treatment.

As clichéd as it may sound, it can also help to take things one day at a time. Instead of thinking about tomorrow, or any pain the futurecouldhold, try to stay present and remember: The future also offers opportunities for joy.

It’s increasingly common for someone to be diagnosed with a condition such as ADHD or autism as an adult. A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers.

Verified byPsychology Today

Sometimes you just don’t feel it.

Sometimes you have a difficult task ahead of you, and all you want to do is give up and hide.

Maybe you need to write a long report.

Maybe you need to make an uncomfortable phone call, that you have been postponing for an uncomfortable amount of days.

Or maybe you just had a bad day and don’t feel like doing anything at all.

We have all been there.

It’s uncomfortable, it’s draining, it’s boring, and it’s frustrating.

And yet there’s no way around the fact that you need to take action.

But how do you support yourself in taking needed action when much of your mind and body just doesn’t want to?

How do you move yourself to act even when you are feeling unmotivated?

If you’re anything like me (or like most people), your go-to strategy is to use self-criticism as a motivator.

In other words, we bully ourselves into taking action.

But while this may work sometimes, it’s not a very effective strategy.

It doesn’t nourish a healthy relationship with yourself.

And even more, research has found a link between self-criticism and unhealthy, avoidant behavior, like watching TV, playing video games, or overeating.

Beating yourself into submission is not a very workable strategy because it pulls from us a deeply worthwhile tendency: to resist coercion.

Evolution itself has primed us to dig in our heels when being bullied, and a good thing too or we’d all fall in line when the next bully showed up.

But what if the “next bully” is the person in the mirror? What if a critical side of you is trying to treat you like a horse to be whipped?

“I don’t wanna” and “you can’t make me” will “win” every time, even at the cost of your own well-being.

Instead, it takes a kinder, more gentle approach.

Down below you’ll find six steps that help you get with your inner barriers, and to carry them with you as you start doing what truly matters.

And it all starts with a simple acknowledgment.

Before anything can change, you have to acknowledge an uncomfortable truth:

Right now, you don’t feel like taking action.

Whatever “taking action” means for you, right now it evokes a lot of difficult feelings, such asboredom, frustration,anger, resentment, or maybe evendepression.

And no matter how much you would like to be motivated, you’re just not. There’s no easy-to-reach “feel good” button on the back of your head (or else you would have found it by now).

Unfortunately, we often cling to “good” feelings, which causes a lot of trouble.

When we cling to feeling “good," we tend to avoid any activity that brings us into contact with difficult feelings. Hence we avoid and postpone “taking action."

Therefore, the first step to make yourself take action is to give up on feeling “good."

Give up on your idea of feeling motivated and driven towards your goal.

The more you cling to “feeling good first," the harder it will be for you to take action.

It’s not just enough to give up on yourattachmentto feeling “good."

As I said, taking action gets you into contact with a lot of difficult thoughts and feelings.

And as long as you struggle with your own feelings of discomfort, you will struggle with taking action.

Let me repeat.

As long as you struggle with feelings of discomfort, as long you will struggle with taking action.

That’s just the nature of the beast.

So instead of making “bad” feelings the enemy, allow yourself to have them.

Stop overcoming barriers, getting through barriers, or defeating barriers. Learn to get with them. Inhale them.

Make room for feelings of discomfort and allow yourself to feel bored, frustrated, and maybe even depressed.

This doesn’t mean that you have to like your difficult feelings.

Nobody does.

But it does mean that your difficult feelings don’t need to change before you can do what truly matters for you.

The sooner you allow yourself to feel discomfort as it is, the sooner you can start taking action.

I am not a masochist, and neither should you be one.

There’s no need to feel discomfort if it’s not in the service of something important.

So let’s figure out what truly matters.

Why is it important for you to take action?

What’s on the other side of taking action?

Is it to enhance yourcareer?

Is it to care for your health?

Or is it about being there for the people that you care about?

See if you can let go of any reasons that come from compliance, applause, or “otherwise I’d feel guilty.”

Instead, focus on taking action for whatever is a very good reason to you. A free choice. Just cuz.

It this kind of “reason why” that matters. It can be a huge source ofmotivationand inspiration.

Get clear on your goals and values, and let them fuel you towards action.

Now it’s time to set a commitment.

What are you willing to commit to?

It doesn’t have to be something big.

You can start with an easy goal, and exercise your willingness muscle. For example, instead of going for a 5 km run, start by going for 500 meters.

You get to make the decision here.

So take a pen and paper, and write down:

Whatare you willing to do?

Whenare you willing to do it?

Whereare you willing to do it?

The more specific you are, the better.

Do something.

Now.

No matter how small.

And then do the next thing, but stay with the process … don’t let the Dictator Within start bossing you around.

If you begin to stumble, recycle through steps 1 through 5 above.

Sometimes the best strategies fall short.

And when this happens, ask yourself this:

Who says youhaveto take action?

Instead of "I cannot take action" tweak that thought over into "Icannot take action."

That is joyfully correct—you are doing it right now! Woo hoo! Awesome.

Own your inaction. Feed your capacity to choose and take responsibility.

Do you know that responsibility was originally writtenresponse ability? By owning your inaction, you are owning your ability to respond.

Are you unhappy with the result?

No problem—if you can not take action then you can take action. That is not a “have to” move. Not even want to. It’s able to. Can.

So if you shift, do it with the same spirit.

Kind. Gentle. Persistent. One step at a time.

You can do it or not.

Up to you.

Free country.

Own your inaction.

Do what you do, get what you get, and keep your eyes wide.

You have the ability to choose based on what works best, whether your mind likes it or not.

There you have it.

These are the six steps you can take toinhaleyour inner barriers and start doing what truly matters.

Give up on the idea of having to feel “good” about taking action, and allow yourself to have difficult feelings.

Connect with the deep reason why “taking action” is important to you in the first place, and set a commitment to what you’re going to do.

Then start, inside that spirit.

And lastly, if everything else fails, own your inaction.

Beating yourself into submission is not a very workable strategy.

You don’t have to bully yourself to care.

You don’t have to bully yourself to live.

Hopelessness may lead you to think about suicide. Learn how to stay safe, get through a crisis and find treatment.

When life does not seem worth living anymore, it may seem that the only way to find relief is through suicide. When you're feeling this way, it may be hard to believe that you have other options.

Take a moment to step back and separate your emotions from your actions. When you feel depressed and think there's no hope, it's much harder to make reasonable decisions. But problems that bring on suicidal feelings can be treated.

It may not be easy, and you might not feel better overnight. Eventually, though, the sense of hopelessness — and thoughts of taking your life — will lift.

If you think you may hurt yourself or take your life, get help right away by taking one of these actions:

Do not try to manage suicidal thoughts or behavior on your own. You need professional help and support to overcome the problems linked to thoughts about taking your life.

Your doctor or mental health professional can help you learn different ways to cope and solve problems. Consider talking about these coping strategies with people who know you well, such as family members or trusted friends.

You may be urged to do things you do not feel like doing, such as talking with friends when you'd rather stay in your bedroom all day. It will get easier to do these things as they become habits.

Create a written plan of action or a "safety plan" with your mental health professional. You can refer to this plan when you're thinking about suicide or are in a crisis. A safety plan includes what makes you think about suicide and how you can cope with those thoughts. Learn to spot your warning signs early, so you can put your plan into action.

Your plan is a checklist of activities and actions you promise to do to stay safe when you have thoughts of suicide, such as:

Even if the immediate crisis passes, see a doctor or mental health professional. This will help you get the right treatment for suicidal thoughts and depression so that you do not always have to be in crisis mode.

As part of your plan, take these steps:

The hopelessness you feel as you consider suicide may be the side effect of a very hard situation or an illness that can be treated. This emotion can be so overpowering that it clouds your judgment and leads you to believe that taking your life is the best, or only, option. But with help, you can change how you think about your situation:

If you’re looking for ideas on how to get unstuck from this feeling, here are some tips.

Life can be unpredictable, and events don’t always work out in your favor.

Maybe you’re unhappy in your career or relationship. Tragedy or unexpected circumstances may have forced you down a new path. Or you may have an underlying medical condition that causes you physical or emotional stress.

No matter the cause, these thoughts are natural.

The very fact you’re having these thoughts likely means you’ve recognized an aspect of your life you wish was different. And this realization is often the first step toward making a change.

If you’re considering self-harm or suicide, help is available right now. You can:

Not in the United States? You can find support in your country withBefrienders Worldwide.

All emotions are reactions to how you perceive the world around you. Both feel-good and uncomfortable emotions play an important part in mental health.

Enjoyable emotions activate your brain’s reward system. They can improve your focus and may help expand your ways of thinking.

Uncomfortable emotions can help protect you. They let you know when things aren’t right. For example, anger might let you know when someone isn’t respecting your boundaries.

Like anger, many other intense emotions can be traced back to our survival instincts. Anxiety and fear were likely important reasons why our ancestors didn’t all get eaten by wild animals.

In the modern world, you may not encounter life-or-death situations every day, but these emotions are still here as part of your early warning system.

Researchsuggests that accepting negative thoughts and emotions is a key component of overall mental well-being. But how do you do that when you’re feeling hopeless, frustrated, and dissatisfied with life?

You may have multiple reasons for feeling the way you do.

Whether these feelings are the result of one experience or years of feeling overwhelmed, exploring parts of your life that are making you feel unhappy could help you find ways to address them.

No two people have exactly the same reasons for feeling frustrated and hopeless about life. Here are some common contributing factors:

Childhood abuse can have significant long-term effects on your mental and physical health.

Experiencing abuse may increase your chances of anxiety, depression, and chronic physical illness later in life. All of these can influence how you feel about life.

Mental health conditions such asdepression,anxiety,bipolar disorder, and many others can cause feelings of hopelessness.

Life is full of stress for most people, and it can come from a number of areas:

Your life circumstances are unique to you. Over time, many of these situations can result inchronic stressand less hope for the future.

Earlyresearchsuggests that substance use or addiction can increase your chances of experiencing mental health conditions as an adult — and currentresearchbacks this up. Some of these conditions, like depression, can influence how you feel about your life.

If you’re already living with a mental health condition,researchalso indicates that feelings of sadness could increase your chances of developing an addiction.

Experiencing the death of a loved one or a major life-changing loss may be a significant source of grief.

Like with other emotions, how you experience grief is unique to you. There is no “right” amount of time it should take you to grieve.

In some cases, grief can lead to depression or thoughts of suicide. You may experience “complicated grief,” in which you feel like life is meaningless.

Negative thoughts about yourself can impact how you feel about life in general.

When you’re unhappy with a part of yourself, those negative feelings may carry over into other aspects of life. You might start to withdraw from others or pull away at work or school.

Areview of literaturefound that low self-esteem was common in young people who internalized intense emotions — especially those also living with depression or anxiety.

Examining why you’re feeling this way about life can help you figure out how to approach making it better.

When negative thoughts about life are persistent, speaking with a mental health professional is just one way to sift through them. Therapy could help you identify sources of unhappiness and start making small, achievable steps toward a life you feel better about.

You can also do this yourself. Asking yourself, “What might make life better?” could help you find ways to change things that are within your control.

For example, if your co-worker across the aisle makes your work day miserable, it might be time to ask for a new desk location — or even a new position in the company.

Not everything in life can be controlled.

Worrying about things you can’t control can take up time and energy. It may also cause unnecessary amounts of stress.

Older researchsuggests that a sense of control is important to mental well-being and is associated with positive emotions. A lack of control — or a lack of choice — is often associated with negative feelings.

As you examine the factors that influence your feelings about life, you may also find it helpful to decide what can and can’t be changed. You can even start with something small, like the clothes you wear, what you eat for lunch, or what you do for the next 5 minutes.

Focusing on those controllable aspects can give you more hope for the future.

Changing what makes you unhappy all at once probably isn’t possible — or practical — but it’s also not necessary. Even small steps can make a difference when it comes to your mental health and satisfaction with life.

A plan to address unhappiness in life will be unique to you and your situation. In some cases, you might want to enlist the help of a mental health professional or supportive loved ones.

If you decide to make a plan, here are some questions to get the ball rolling:

If you’re unhappy with a co-worker at your job, quitting on the spot may not be only answer.

By starting with a minor change, like a new desk or separate office space, you may make enough of a difference to change how you feel about that aspect of your life.

Small adjustments can have major effects. And having success on this smaller scale can help build your confidence to make the bigger changes.

Saying “no” can be difficult, especially with family and friends. Before you know it, you can overextend yourself.

Boundaries also help protect your energy and resources, and they let others know what you will and won’t tolerate.

Maintainingboundariescan help prevent you from experiencing situations that may spark emotions like stress, sadness, or anxiety.

Being able to express your needs and feelings can keep you from internalizing them.

Open communication may help you work through concerns rather than allowing them to swirl in your head, causing anxiety.

Exercising and eating nutritious food could boost your mood. Even making sure you’re staying hydrated can change how you feel in a big way.

Moving your body can stimulate the brain and produce feel-good hormones to help combat depression. Andresearchsuggests there’s no need to overdo it. Even moderate-intensity exercise could give you the mood-boosting effects associated with exercise.

When feelings of hopelessness linger, consider reaching out for professional support. Some causes of unhappiness in life may require in-depth exploration and discovery.

You may benefit from certain treatments or medications.

If speaking with a professional isn’t an option for you at the moment, other resources are also available, including:

If you’re in need of local resources, many physician offices will have a list of names and numbers to contact.

You can also find acomplete list of crisis resources hereif you’re looking for immediate help, or explore thesefree mental health support optionsif you’re feeling unsure about the cost of therapy.

Making a plan might not impact how you’re feeling right now. While unpleasant, the feelings you’re experiencing are real and valid.

Chances are you won’t feel like this forever. But if you’re feeling overwhelmed and need something to take your mind off these thoughts as they pass over you, here are some ideas for what to do in the meantime:

It’s natural to feel frustrated with life’s challenges. Almost everyone has felt this way at some point, and there’s no shame in having these thoughts and feelings.

If these thoughts are frequent and have been affecting your day-to-day life, it could be a sign to check in with your doctor or another healthcare professional. When these feelings are persistent, they could be a symptom of an undiagnosed medical or mental health condition.

Sometimes when we feel like this, there’s a lot of pressure to “feel better” right away. It’s OK tolet that pressure goand spend some time just letting yourself be.

How to Start a Therapy Session as a Therapist - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7r6RWo-z0

Transcript:
(00:00) what's up everybody I hope you're doing well so lately I've kind of been thinking about those aspects of therapy that are so kind of just ingrained default innate that at least in my circles we don't end up really talking about them all that much and I thought today we might talk a little bit about how to structure the beginning of your therapy session now before getting into this video I want to make clear that I'm just kind of sharing my own personal Reflections about what I think is important to consider at the beginning
(00:28) of a session and also your individual licensure jurisdiction may have its own legislation and ethical guidelines for how you're expected to conduct the beginning of your session so make sure you're also brushing up on those things as well okay now let's get into these tips so my first tip for how to structure the beginning of your therapy sessions is before the sessions ever even started and that's to be prepared this just takes like one to two minutes of my time per client I'm looking back
(00:55) at the old note just to see what are the treatment goals we're focusing on right now how do we focus on them last time and should we continue that thread for today what would that look like in today's session on my particular therapeutic approach I am always happy to deviate from whatever thread we were on last time to pick up on some new Direction based on what's come up but it's also really helpful to make sure we're holding the frame of here's what we've been working on should we continue
(01:19) with this thread or are we choosing to intentionally move in a different direction and my next tip for how to structure the beginning of your sessions is start on time please now there are definitely one-off times where I start session one or two maybe three minutes late but if this is happening consistently for you or you're getting much later than that in starting your sessions that is a problem it's like before your sessions even started your client is already getting this impression of you that you don't really
(01:47) have time for them you have other priorities so that's not really a good foot to start off on the next tip for how to structure the beginning of your sessions is for however you structure things to keep it fairly consistent again you can always deviate from your structure but if you have a consistent structure that you pretty much stick by every single time you meet with your clients then that sense of routine creates its own type of safety for your clients but consistency also creates like helpful cues like oh we're entering
(02:16) the therapy session now because Marie is saying the same thing she kind of says every single time so keep that value of consistency in mind as we continue to talk about the rest of the tips here the next thing to consider for how you structure the beginning of your session is what sort of niceties or like kind of polite remarks you might offer at the very beginning of your session or particularly for in-person sessions that time between senior client in the waiting room and walking into the office personally I feel most comfortable
(02:43) offering some kind of polite commentary that is not related to what we're doing in therapy at all because we're like walking in a semi-public space in the waiting room and hallway but I might say something like oh it's so good to see you or hey did you make it here okay in the rain outside of course this is something that's totally up to you you can tailor it to your own style and therapeutic approach whether you decide to offer some sort of you know polite niceties or not it is helpful to kind of
(03:08) have a sense of like what's on brand for me in that sense what aligns with my therapeutic approach so that however I'm interacting with a client in the waiting room is consistent with what they're experiencing from me once we're actually in the session and though it plays out a little bit different in Virtual therapy because you don't have to walk from point A to point B it can be worth considering whether you have any sort of niceties that you like to mention at the beginning of your session the next tip
(03:33) is to consider what Avenues of hospitality you might like to lean into at the beginning of your session I talked about this in a recent video and you can make it your own but I always like to kind of check in with my clients like do you need something to drink is the temperature okay anything that might align with trying to help your client feel as comfortable as possible so that they feel ready to engage with the session and the next tip is specific for virtual therapy sessions it can be really helpful to do a check-in about
(04:00) technology confidentiality and also location I almost always start off the virtual therapy session by saying something like hey can you hear me okay good I can hear you also just kind of acknowledging that technology seems to be working okay or it's I'm sorry there's a little bit of an echo can I try to adjust change my volume kind of situate ourselves within technology we are also expected to know where our client is located just in case of some sort of emergency where we need to call for help for somebody to to show
(04:28) up to them in person with that said it may not always be kind of therapeutically advantageous to say tell me your address every single time you see a client I notice most of my clients tend to sit in the exact same spot every time we meet and so I can just tell by looking at their background that yes indeed they're again in their home sitting in the exact same place as last time and every other time we've met but sometimes I might log on to a call with a client it looks like they're in their parked car or just in a different
(04:56) location in which case I try to find a casual way to kind of check in to know where they're located and then of course for virtual therapy sessions the confidentiality piece is just so much more challenging to kind of hold consistent because we can't control the environment that our client is existing in so if there's any clues that we can see that maybe confidentiality might be compromised we definitely want to check in on that and try to ensure confidentiality of the best of your ability the next tip for how to
(05:21) structure the beginning of your sessions is as appropriate have space for a safety and symptom check second now again I said this is as appropriate because if you across the board asked every single person if they thought about harming themselves or somebody else or if they've had any symptoms of depression anxiety if they've used substances Etc it just wouldn't be appropriate to ask that for every single person but depending on the population you work with and particularly specific clients needs it may make sense to kind
(05:48) of have dedicated time at the beginning of each session to check in on somebody's symptoms by having this right at the beginning of your session it ensures that you don't miss anything important that might be going on such as you know significant thoughts of self-harm for example or other disruptive symptoms and also it shows to your client that you care and then after you've done all of these things then you can sort of kick off your formal structure for your session this obviously needs to be tailored to your
(06:15) specific therapeutic approach and to each specific client whatever structure you're utilizing for your sessions but whether you use a more structured or less structured approach I find it helpful to still have some consistency and how you kick things off because this kind of helps clients know what to expect I generally say kind of the same thing every single session just in different paraphrasing so it's usually something like so we can always pick up where we left off last time or if there's something that's come up that
(06:43) feels relevant we can start with that do you have a preference for where we start from and this is where those preparations we talked about at the beginning really come in handy because I really love to be able to have a synopsis of like one to two sentences of saying yeah last time we focused on this this and this and we kind of earmarked this other thing as something we could come back to or something you would work on and then they generally go oh yeah you're right okay and we can kind of pick up from where we left off and then
(07:06) of course if something significant popped up since last time then you know I created the structure for them to kind of interrupt where we left off to say oh actually can we talk about this other thing that happened and you know we can just earmark where we left off to come back to later now even though it's taken me a while to list all of the tips in this video in practice it just takes one or maybe two minutes to run through all of these at the beginning of session and then let the time be for the client to
(07:30) work through all the stuff that they're working through so it doesn't have to take up that much space but by having this set at the beginning of every single session there's a sense of consistency which helps Foster routine which helps Foster safety your clients kind of know what they're stepping into every single session and they also feel like you're prepared because you remember what we talked about last time you showed up on time you considered my needs by you know asking if I needed a
(07:56) glass of water all these little things just add up so your client could say okay let's get to it and before we close I'd like to thank therapynotes.com for sponsoring this video therapy notes helps with scheduling notes billing you can charge your clients card on file they have a HIPAA secure Telehealth platform and so many other features if you'd like to check out therapy notes you can get two months to try it for free with no commitment just by clicking the link in the description of this video I hope you found this video
(08:21) helpful and I'm aware as I make this video that this structure that I'm describing fits for the type of population the type of work that I do and I'm imagining that as some of you are watching you might be thinking ah Marie you forgot this important piece which might be relevant for somebody working in a different context so if that's coming up for you feel free to leave a comment below so other folks can kind of learn from your experience as well and until next time from one therapist to another I wish you well



5 Things to Do Before You Start Therapy or Counseling - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgC6ZLE8QhY

Transcript:
(00:00) you're gonna poop in the yard Roxy it's a pee pee poo poo situation okay thanks honey therapy can be an incredibly beneficial and life-changing experience but getting in to see someone can be stressful and take a lot of time and energy so what can we do ahead of time to ensure we get the right help ask the right questions and get the most out of therapy well that's what I want to talk with you about today here are the five things that we should do before starting therapy starting off with number five is
(00:31) keep track of your symptoms no you don't need to know the right terminology I don't need you to know that what you're describing is major depressive disorder I just need to you to write down like how it feels what you think and what's bothering you it's kind of like when you take your car into the shop to get looked at and I don't know what the different parts are let's be honest either just tell them the sounds that it's making I'm like it was like or it's not breaking right or something
(00:57) like that right we just tell them what's happening from our perspective and let them sort it out and therapy is no different you don't have to know that what you're experiencing is a panic attack for example you just have to let them know that sometimes when you feel overwhelmed you space out you sweat a lot and you think you're gonna pass out it's the therapist's job to take all that information in and help figure out what's going on then they help you implement some new tools and techniques to help you feel
(01:28) better and we kind of trial and error that too right we're figuring it out together next up is number four and that is to set some goals for ourselves and our time in therapy this could be as simple as I want to feel better or I don't want to be angry all the time for me it's always like I don't want to cry at inappropriate times I'm just overwhelmed right it could even be as detailed as I want to get better at communicating my needs to my partner now there's this style of therapy called
(01:55) solution focused therapy and while I don't love every part of it I do love what they call the miracle question and in this type of therapy your therapist will ask you if you woke up tomorrow and all of your problems were fixed how would you know essentially we're trying to get an idea of what your life would be like if things were better and then we can ask questions to figure out what specifically had changed now this helps us not only guide the work we do together but also ensure that we're working toward the same goals
(02:28) before getting into therapy it is helpful to know what we want to get out of it that can help guide the type of therapists we see and what questions we ask them in our first session there are quite a few we should ask to be honest but that's a topic for a whole another video so take some time and consider what it is you hope to get out of it and see if you can come up with a way to communicate that when you finally make that first appointment next up is number three and we should consider our budget I made this mistake
(02:58) when I was in graduate school and my long time therapist was forced to retire she gave me a few referrals and highly recommended this one near my apartment in Santa Monica so I called I made an appointment but I forgot to ask how much it was going to be she also didn't tell me by the way but her first session ended so I'd already been in there I'd already seen her she'd already offered a service and I was shocked that it was going to cost me a hundred and fifty dollars this was also back in like 2009
(03:26) but I wasn't even working full time obviously I was in grad school I barely made enough to cover my books gas rent so I was like I asked her if she worked on a sliding scale and she gave me 30 off so I wrote the check and I didn't make another appointment even though I actually did really like her I was just upset my dad had just died my other therapist had to retire and I really just needed to see someone so make sure you figure out what you can afford long term we never know how long we're gonna need
(04:01) therapy right it's not something we can go in and be like you're going to need successions some things take more time or some things take you just it's up we don't know and we don't want to get into a situation where we like them like I did connect with them but then can't afford to keep seeing them or Worse we put ourselves into credit card debt so that we can keep seeing them that's not good either the last thing therapy should do is stress you out more so run your numbers check your budget
(04:28) and see what works for you and remember that there are lower costs available things like better help you can there's a link in the description you get a discount talk space and online groups like those offered at Hope for Recovery um I'll put the link down there as well or 988 is the new 911 for mental health emergencies super cool and the crisis text line is available at 741-741 now I know the crisis text line isn't licensed professionals but when we just need someone to talk to an event about things
(04:56) they do have trained crisis counselors available 24 7. moving on to number two and that is to write down some things you'd like to see in your therapist think about it like what traits do those that we love and Trust most have are there certain things people do that make you more or less comfortable considering what we want to see in a therapist is incredibly helpful too often we get into that first appointment and even if we don't like them we just assume we have to keep seeing them but remember the number one indicator of
(05:29) success in therapy is the therapeutic relationship meaning that if we don't like them or think that they get us it's not going to be as beneficial or maybe even beneficial at all and also this is not a time to be PC either do you prefer a man or a woman someone old or young do you want to have a similar background to them like culture race sexuality do we need to ask them if they're part of the lgbtq plus Community or at least an ally we all have preferences when it comes to who we talk to for example my
(06:02) therapist has to be a woman kind of hippie like and older than me by at least 10 years and bonus points if she sits cross-legged while we talk so no judgment on what works for you just take the time to think about it and that could help you decide whether to make an appointment with them or not and finally number one is to ask for a phone consultation all therapists offer these and they should be free of charge usually they last 20 to 30 minutes although I have heard some of you tell me that they only give you 15 and others an entire hour so
(06:39) just make sure to ask them how long it's going to be also many of you told me that they even do these in person sometimes which can help us determine whether or not they're a good fit furthermore this gives you an opportunity to ask them questions about their practice their specialty cost and what styles of therapy they offer I'm glad that most therapists offer these because it can be hard to know if you're going to like someone or not if you don't see them in person or even talk to them on the phone not to mention that it
(07:05) can get really expensive doing all of these one-off therapy appointments and we aren't really getting any therapeutic benefit from them know that if they don't offer a free phone consultation you can get an idea of who they are and what they specialize in by looking at their website or any reviews they have online it's not perfect but it can help you narrow down who you want to see and who you don't think would be a good fit again no need to be PC here what's important is that you find someone that
(07:34) you like who can help you with your issues because therapy can be life-changing but we have to find someone we connect with which is why encourage you to do these five things before starting and just to recap those five things because I know it's a lot to keep in your brain at once they are keep track of your symptoms you can just do it in the notes on your phone set some goals for ourselves and our time in therapy consider our budget write down some things you would like to see in your therapist and ask for a phone consultation I hope
(08:06) that helps you find the right therapist and get the support that you need when you finally decide to reach out have a wonderful week and I'll see you next time








It’s increasingly common for someone to be diagnosed with a condition such as ADHD or autism as an adult. A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers.

Stepping intotherapycan be a life-changing experience and the start of a journey that can take us through unexpected discoveries and insights. An unavoidable part of this is building a trusting relationship with a complete stranger: our therapist.

We will be revealing the deepest parts of ourselves, perhaps stories we might never have talked with anyone about before. It’s both exciting and daunting, and we want to make sure we create the best possibilities for an encouraging beginning to this journey of self-discovery. But where do we start?

It is worth putting in a little effort to ensure we get the absolute best from our investment of emotions, time, and money. There are some very simple and practical preparations we can do to create a good foundation for our therapeutic journey.

Preparing will also build ourconfidencewhen we finally contact our chosen therapist. Plus, it will make us more comfortable engaging with therapy right from the beginning.

Finding the right therapy for us and our issues can seem overwhelming: with so many different types of therapies available, how can we know which is the best for us?

We could say that any therapy is better than none, though to have the best chance of success, it is worth considering our own requirements rather than looking for a specific type of therapy. Here are some questions that might help:

Some therapists specialize in working with individuals, these could be counselors or psychotherapists. Others might have specialized in working with relationships such as couple’s counselors or psychosexual and relationship therapists, or family therapists.

Deciding who is seeking therapy will help us narrow down our search.

Some therapies are based on creating changes through giving homework and consciously changing thoughts and behaviors. Others are based mainly on making changes by talking, thinking, and reflecting on our thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and preoccupations. If we like a bit of both, then there is that option too.

Consider this: If we dislike homework and know that we are unlikely to carry out the required tasks between sessions, it is unlikely we will gain much from this type of therapy.

On the other hand, if we prefer homework, we might get frustrated by a therapy that is focused on talking and contemplating.

If we know what works best for us, we are more likely to find success in therapy. We can talk with the therapist during our initial conversation to clarify if their method suits our preferred way of working.

Being able to name the issues we bring to therapy can make us feel a little more confident when we first contact a therapist and during our first session. Something as simple as asking ourselves why we feel in need of therapy can clarify if for example we feel overwhelmed,anxious,depressed, or scared.

These are not the only reasons to seek therapy and remember: No issue is too small or too big for therapy. Knowing a little about what we are seeking help with will make our first conversation with a therapist easier.

It is always best to seek a therapist who is qualified, accredited or licensed, and registered with one of many associations especially established for therapists. Alternatively, we could search thePsychology Today Therapy Directory.

These should give us some choices close to where we live. If we are looking for a relationship or family therapist, we can add that description to our search, so we get the appropriate results.

On the association’s website or the Psychology Today directory, we will find a list of therapists who we can be sure are qualified and have trained to an acceptable standard.

Along with their contact details, their listing will tell us what the therapist works with and if they have specialized in any therapeutic area. If we are looking for help with something specific, it is worth, if possible, finding a therapist who has specialized in the area we are seeking help with.

It isn’t always the first therapist we contact that is a fit for us, so having the details of two or three will give us options.

We need a therapist with whom we can get on with, someone who "gets us" and we feel able to build trust in. This is an important part of what is called thetherapeutic relationshipand for our success in therapy. In other words, we need this relationship to be a good fit for us.

We also need to think about where the therapist practices from and if we can get to where they are on a regular basis. Most therapists would like to see us weekly, so we need to be sure we can make the appointments at this frequency.

Of course, some therapists are happy to work online, via email, or telephone. If that is how we need to work, then where the therapist practices from to some extent becomes irrelevant.

It is a good idea to try to get to know our therapist a little before we make an appointment. Therapists are used to being asked questions by potential clients and will be happy to answer any that relate to therapy. Personal questions, however, are not as appropriate for this type of relationship.

Talking with them on the phone is probably the best way to make the initial contact. Our first conversation will give us an idea if they are a good fit for us. To get the conversation started, here are a few questions that might help us:

Finding a good fit:

Practical questions:

A question that will help us and our therapist if we are to make an appointment:

The first call is always the hardest but being equipped with all the information we need will make this first step easier.

Remember: We are the ones hiring our therapist. It is us who needs the fit to be right so we can progress emotionally and psychologically. Feeling reasonably comfortable talking on the phone with our therapist will give us an indication of how we might get on in person.

When we do arrange an appointment, be certain that the day and time are manageable. Being late or missing this appointment altogether can make for an awkward start to our therapy. Let’s give ourselves the best possible start and make sure we can attend the first session with a little time to spare.

It’s increasingly common for someone to be diagnosed with a condition such as ADHD or autism as an adult. A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers.


Therapy is designed to help you feel better and live better. Here are some tips to help you get started.

Therapy, also known as psychotherapy, talk therapy, or counseling, aims to help you tackle troubling emotions, thoughts, behaviors or life situations.

On a routine basis, therapy involves visiting with a mental health professional one-on-one, whether online or in person. Startingpsychotherapyis a personal decision, so you decide what environment or schedule works best for you.

Everyone’s reasons for seeking therapy are different. Some people attend therapy every week for years, while others just go for a few sessions. Most importantly, if you feel like you need someone to talk to right now, or if difficulties are greatly interfering with your life — this is probably a good time to start therapy!

Therapy aims to investigate the root cause of your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Your therapist can help you shine a light on harmful patterns, and assist you with adjusting and coping.

People seek out therapy for a variety of reasons, including:

Let’s look at some general tips for starting therapy.

Primary care physicians and family doctors area great resourcefor whole-body health issues. Your doctor can refer you to a mental health professional that fits your needs.

Mental health is just as important as physical health, so be open and honest about how you’re feeling, and don’t be afraid to ask questions.

Primary care physicians often refer people to a psychiatrist, which is a mental health professional who can prescribe medication. If you want a referral to a therapist or counselor, request this early on.

While your doctor might have a name in mind right away, you can also do your own research.

While many people like and stick with their first therapist, others need to try different options before settling in. Working to improve your mental health is a journey, so try not to be discouraged if things don’t work out perfectly at first.

Here’s some guidance for finding the right therapist:

You might consider looking for a therapist who understands your cultural background, or has expertise in working with people from your community.

No matter what you’re looking for in a mental health professional, there’s someone out there for you.

Sometimes, it’s helpful to bring a loved one toyour first appointmentfor emotional support. You may feel nervous or anxious, and feel more comfortable knowing that someone you trust is waiting outside.

If you feel like having a loved one in the room with you would be helpful, you might consider:

You can consider your therapy sessions a no-judgment zone, so make sure you remain as open and honest as possible at all times!

If you are over 18, your therapist is bound by confidentiality. This means anything you discuss in your sessions is completely private — with exceptions including homicide, suicide, and abuse.

If you are under 18, therapists are trained to bring information to parents only in rare circumstances, and the therapist will inform the client before they do so.

Having clear communication and a secure level of trust allows therapy to work effectively and efficiently. The more information your therapist has, the more they can help. Try to explain your symptoms in detail, including severity and frequency.

A strong relationship with a mental health professional depends on communication from both parties.

Feel free to ask questions, whether about the process of therapy or your symptoms. Your therapist is there to not only listen, but also to give you constructive feedback and guidance.

This includes openly discussing your goals with your therapist. Ask yourself, “What do I want to get out of therapy?”

Your therapist will alsohave some questionsfor you. Their queries may include basic demographic information and your reasons for seeking therapy.

When you connect with your therapist, you will want to ask some of the followingquestions:

If you don’t feel an ideal connection with the first therapist you try — don’t stress! This is completely normal, and you may have to meet a few different therapists until youfind the one right for you.

First impressions can be misleading, so even if you don’t click right away, it can be helpful to give that therapist a try for a few sessions, and then switch if needed.

The American Psychological Association estimates there are85,000licensed psychologists in the United States, so you have plenty of options to choose from.

When you initiate contact, it’s best to speak to a potential therapist on the phone or via video call to get a feel for their personality and style. This can help you feel more confident going into that first appointment.

Try to remember therapy is a process, not an overnight fix.

If you walk out of your first appointment feeling the same, or even worse, don’t be alarmed. It usually takes several sessions to develop a rapport with your therapist, and working through your thoughts and feelings takes time.

Sometimes, therapy may make you temporarily feel worse before you feel better, as you bring up difficult or traumatic emotions and experiences. Remember it’s okay to set boundaries around topics you aren’t ready to dive into yet. And it’s okay to cry.

Trust the process and focus on the work at hand. You got this!

Hope is at the heart of therapy.

You can continue your wellness journey by finding a therapist you’re interested in meeting with, and scheduling your first appointment.

Feel confident that you can feel better and live happier, and that by reaching out for support, you’ve taken a crucial step forward.

Insomnia- How to Fall Asleep When your Brain Won't Shut Up! - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6QK5UEXLYc

Transcript:
(00:00) so a member of my online community asked me this um if you're laying in bed trying to go to sleep and you find your mind erasing feeling really anxious what's the next best thing to stop the anxiety cycle now you all know that feeling like i' I've been there you've got a big day ahead of you or you've had a really long day behind you and you really need to sleep like you're so tired but when you finally lay down your mind starts running and you worry about everything or you can't stop thinking
(00:28) about all the mistakes you made throughout the day you could feel your stress levels rise and despite your best efforts you can't sleep and that makes you more anxious which perpetuates the cycle and on it goes you desperately want to sleep but your brain won't shut up so in this video you'll learn why your brain doesn't trust you to process these thoughts during the day and you'll learn what you can do about this there is something you can do about it so let's talk about the science behind why
(00:56) your brain gets stuck doing this and three things you can do to escape that cycle [Music] okay so first thing about your brain you can't just force yourself to stop thinking about something we'd like to think that we can control our thoughts you might think like oh I have to force my mind to calm down or I have to stop thinking about work I have to stop worrying or else I won't be able to sleep and and again this is the classic problem with the pink elephant try not to think about a pink elephant and what
(01:27) happens you think about it now we we really can have a lot of influence over our thoughts but it's not through Force it's through attention what we pay attention to we get more of so just like a toddler who says a naughty word if we give her positive or negative attention she's going to say that word more so with our thoughts when we try to stop thinking about those things we accidentally tell our brain those things are really important and it makes the thoughts louder and so the more we struggle to control our racing thoughts
(01:59) the harder it is to sleep it's uh engaging in a struggle to sleep it's like putting on our armor and riding horseback in an attempt to go to sleep it's it's just going to make us very alert so the first step is it's just much more helpful to notice and acknowledge those thoughts than it is to try to stop your thoughts from racing and this is an essential principle from mindfulness you just notice that you're having a stressful thought and you say oh thank you mind for that thought and
(02:29) then you let the thought pass on and you could develop this skill by practicing mindfulness or you could try the activity leaves on a stream which um hopefully I'll remember to link in the description below okay now I'm not going to spend too much time on this because I want to really jump into the next essential strategy so if we really want to solve the problem of raising thoughts in rumination at night we need to understand why the heck your brain would do this to you like when your brain brings up all of these stressful
(02:55) thoughts it's doing its job it's trying to solve a problem or address a threat so for example you're like oh did I say something stupid today what if I'm rejected from the tribe and I'm kicked out of the village and I die of starvation or did I remember everything for the presentation tomorrow what if I get fired and die of starvation better run triple checks right your your brain survival instincts that is trying to tie up Loose Ends but in the middle of the night it's not a great time to actually
(03:23) solve problems so you end up like running in these mental circles so so why would your brain bring these things up at the exact time when you want to relax and fall asleep because it doesn't trust you to address them during the day one of the reasons that we get racing thoughts at night is because we keep ourselves so busy so occupied and so distracted during the day I mean heck we even stare at a screen while we're on the toilet uh we keep our minds occupied nearly every waking moment and this makes it so that our brain doesn't have
(03:52) time to file away our memories and to work through our to-do lists and and work through any worries that we have so the m we finally stop being busy and close our eyes and and remove distractions our brain is like aha now's my chance to file away each of these thoughts or work through each of these concerns um it's like updates on a computer like keeping busy all day is like constantly telling your computer that you're going to do the update later until finally your computer just forces the update on you
(04:22) right in the middle of something important if you don't choose when you're going to process through your thoughts and worries your brain will will decide to do it when you lay down to sleep so what's the antidote make time during the day for your brain to run its updates to work through its worries and to do some housekeeping so what does it look like on a practical level um first get rid of mindless distractions during the day so this usually means being more intentional about your social media use
(04:51) so instead of randomly using social media all throughout the day schedule in short time periods when you will use social media and then use an app Locker to stop the impulsive usage during the day and this is going to open up tiny moments during the day to process those thoughts like when you're waiting in line or sitting on the toilet or taking a shower hey everyone real quick if you'd like to learn more skills to improve your mental health check out my courses at therapy inan nutshell.
(05:20)  comom I've got eight mental health courses that can help you regulate your nervous system learn to improve your mental health and work through anxiety and other really big intense emotions by June 10th of this year we're going to put all of the courses into a membership to make it really easy for everyone to access the courses the workbooks the videos plus live q&as and monthly webinars so that you can keep learning and improve your mental health okay back to the video the second step is to add in quiet time to process during your day
(05:49) so this might look like a quiet walk where you aren't listening to stocks or you allow yourself to just do nothing for a few minutes at a time okay like I'm really terrible at that but I can like turn off my devices and go like work in the yard for a minute and that's a good way for my brain to process uh another thing that's really helpful is like schedule in a Time Each Day to write down your worries and your to-do list um like toddlers our brains don't handle being told uh not to do something
(06:18) like don't hit I'm like well what you just said hit that's the only word I heard uh our brain doesn't handle like don't worry very well but our brains do do very good job with knowing when it to do something so if you say okay I want you to worry at 5:00 P p.m. every day I want you to go through the to-do list at 6:00 a.m.
(06:40)  every day whatever it is right um so for example you could do this by like before you leave work for the day you could um write down everything that your brain wants to process and leave them there like a 5 minute like transition period of like okay here's my to-do list for tomorrow and then you leave it at work um at home you could check off your to-do list every evening at dinner time for example uh or before you start your bedtime routine you could review review your calendar for the next day so your brain knows that it doesn't
(07:10) have to remind you of anything when you're ready to sleep uh you could also practice scheduled worry and I've got a bunch videos on this if you don't know what that is but it's basically you're making time for your braing to worry you're teaching it to trust you that everything has been processed so that it doesn't have to nag you about them at night and and I would say this is the best long-term strategy for dealing with worries at night now you don't want to make a habit of dealing with anxious
(07:36) thoughts when your head hits the pillow but if you do find yourself in the situation where it's night time and you have this like dumb truckload of worries hit you right as you're trying to sleep you you just have a great option here you can choose what's going to be most restful for you you can just lie there just noticing these thoughts and letting them pass like leaves on a stream or you could get up write them down wait until you feel sleepy and then go back to bed for me most of the time I do get up I do
(08:04) a brain dump where I just like write everything down on a piece of paper and that often breaks the anxiety cycle for me so that I can get back to bed now again prevention is the best way to manage these racing thoughts uh process your worries during the day if you're chronically anxious and distracted during the day if if you don't work through your anxiety during the day there are no magical fixes at night um so if you don't know how to do this if don't know how to process your thoughts you could check out my how to process
(08:32) emotions um online course okay so you've learned about attention and you're going to practice some mindfulness which is dropping the struggle with your thoughts You' started processing your worries during the day writing them down um gives your brain some time to work through them and you've shown your brain when you do solve problems you do it at work or you write events on your calendar or you keep a to-do list on your computer but what should you do if you still get raising thoughts at that
(09:00) night you you you've done all this processing stuff the third skill is to learn to gently redirect your attention instead of trying to stop thinking you can acknowledge these worries erasing thoughts but then just shift your attention to something more restful so here's three things you could pay attention to instead number one gratitude practice um to feed the sense of abundance in your life just start making list in your head of all the things that you are grateful for and this can counteract sense of worry with
(09:31) a reminder of how blessed you are number two guided imagery you could listen to a guided meditation or walk through of a beautiful place or a gentle sleep story or you can build your own personal visualization of your favorite places or memories okay and then number three limited distraction so I like to listen to a somewhat dull audio book or a soothing podcast um for me it's archaeology stories like the fall of civilizations or down Brown history um other people like Bob Ross or sleep stories or ASMR uh basically anything
(10:05) that helps you drop the struggle with your thoughts or drop the struggle to sleep that can help your natural sleep Drive kick in now remember distraction is a funny thing right during the day too much distraction makes problems pile up distraction will never solve your problems but at bedtime distraction can help by redirecting your thoughts to something more restful instead of something stressful in my next video on sleep I'm inviting insomnia expert Martin Reed to teach us how to drop the struggle of sleep and
(10:36) overcome insomnia but for raising thoughts here are the main steps to take accept that you can't force your thoughts to stop instead tell your brain when and where to process through those thoughts during the day and then number three schedule in quiet or unstructured time without screens or stimulation and then practice scheduled worry or brain dumps to put your wores on paper then number four redirect your attention at night to mindfulness gratitude or relaxing distraction in the long run this train your brain that nighttime or
(11:09) the bed is a restful time and little by little you really can break the cycle of sleep anxiety and the to okay thank you so much for watching and take care oh I do have a playlist on sleep if you'd like to learn more you could check that out [Music] m [Music]

(00:00) Can't sleep? You're not alone. Neither can I. And as it turns out nor can millions of us. Around 30% of people in the UK suffer from poor sleep and one in 10 would meet criteria for insomnia. If you're someone who struggles with sleep, you've probably seen a lot of this. Hi guys, how I fall asleep quickly … If you have insomnia, you're not working hard enough.
(00:27) And you may have tried some of these. I highly recommend this if you're having any issues with sleep. But that elusive cure is hard to find and all the while, you're still lying awake. So I'm just going to lie here for the next three and a half hours until about half an hour before my alarm goes off.
(00:48) When I'll fall to sleep. If it isn't already obvious, I'm an insomniac. And I'm trying to find out why curing insomnia is so hard when the problem seems so simple. I'm speaking to sleep experts, other insomniacs and I'm also monitoring my sleep online, which has been surprisingly helpful.
(01:12) I'll come back to that later, but first I want to know what's going wrong. Why can't I sleep? Occasionally something happens in life  that disrupts sleep for a bit and it's acute but it settles. You know, you move house, the dog dies,  it's Christmas, mother-in-law is coming around … It doesn't matter, there's something acutely stressful and it's a normal response, at one level, to be a little on edge and not to sleep as well.
(01:40) But that usually settles, it doesn't become this engrained habit where you start to chase sleep. If you go three, four, five nights a week, so most nights of the week, for three months or more that would be defined as insomnia disorder. You know, this has become a problem. And then people with chronic insomnia, they start to do things, not deliberately but they're making the night worse.
(02:03) They start to chase sleep, they start to become much more preoccupied with the act of sleep itself, so paradoxically, they are making insomnia worse. It's 2:43am. I woke up at half past 12, went back to sleep again, woke up at half past two. It's quarter past five, I've been awake since 3:30.
(02:27) My mind can't stop thinking. It's obvious to me that insomnia has a lot to do with what's going on in the mind. To find out more about it, I spoke to a clinical psychologist and he started by looking over a sleep diary that I've been keeping for the past two weeks. Hello. Hi. Nice to meet you.
(02:51) Nice to meet you too. So Leah, I've had a look at your sleep diary, very well kept by the way, so thank you very much. Thank you. What I can see is that you have quite an irregular pattern. There's days where you are getting two or three hours sleep at night and there are days when you are getting much more.
(03:06) The times your getting out of bed can vary from really, really early in the morning to midday. I'd like to add, that is just at the weekend. Something that lots of people who describe poor sleep report is that before they go to sleep, they tend to get this buildup of what we call 'excessively negative cognitions'.
(03:24) Pretty unpleasant thoughts about sleep, so things like, you know, I just know I'm going to have another rubbish night tonight, you know, I bet you I'm not going to be able to get to sleep. Oh yeah, I think about how well I'm going to sleep that night probably for about two hours every day. Up until relatively recently, sleep problems such as insomnia was often seen as kind of a secondary complaint to things like mood disturbance or anxiety and it was sort of relegated to the back of the queue
(03:50) and we treated the other elements of the picture but then also didn't really put too much attention on insomnia. Yeah, I sometimes feel like embarrassed to complain about it because all I'm really saying is that I'm tired and everyone's tired, aren't they? But I kind of think if people understood a little bit more what it is we're saying when we say we're really tired, then it would be taking a bit more seriously.
(04:13) It's not only the effect it has on you, the change it brings into your life. but it's also the social aspect of it which is very difficult to deal with. I generally find it quite hard to navigate my way sensibly through a conversation. I can't commit to people events even holidays that I love.
(04:35) Even go to the cinema is sometimes an effort. Poor sleep isn't just about feeling groggy the next day. Stuff like mental health problems, heart disease, diabetes and cancer are more likely if you're not getting the rest you need. So it is a pretty big deal. Every function within brain and body requires sleep.
(04:55) So whether it's immune function, whether it's when your growth hormone's secreted, whether it's the control of metabolism, whether it's consolidating all of your memories. So it's an absolute necessity, it's just not something we can do without or interrupt for any length of time at all.
(05:13) But if you've ever been to the doctor for this, you've probably been told stuff that you've already heard. Eat a banana before bed, turn off your phone, take a relaxing bath, take some sleeping pills … But if you're anything like me, you'll agree that this stuff just isn't good enough.
(05:28) It can feel quite unfair. So if it's like, getting up at 6am every morning to go for a run, only eat salad all day, coming home, not doing anything an evening apart from read a book, going to bed at 9pm … Do you know what I mean? So whereas people who just sleep don't have to think about any of this stuff and I kind of think, well I can't be bothered to do any of this, I just want to do what I want and then I deserve to go to sleep.
(05:54) It's a really good point. You do deserve to go to sleep and you don't deserve to worry about all this stuff. I see people in clinic every week and they say, you know, all I've had for years is sleep hygiene leaflets and it doesn't work and I would totally agree the evidence is very clear that sleep hygiene is not a treatment in and of itself, it's a foundation on which we build good sleep.
(06:17) I don't smoke, I only drink socially. I don't have any caffeine apart from the odd chocolate bar. I've tried sleeping tablets and meditation and yoga and nothing really helped. There's two problems that GPs have: one is a practical management issue, they don't have the resources to help people where sleep's concerned, because they only have access to sleeping pills.
(06:40) They don't like to disappoint the patients,  so they end up giving them a doses of treatment that are not effective like suggesting things or maybe your room's not ventilated well enough, things that people already know. With professional medical help lacking, there's an endless stream of videos, forums and products that all claim to solve your sleep problem.
(07:02) And I am definitely not immune. I've downloaded all the sleep apps, tried all the at home remedies, invested in expensive bedding and spent way too much on the latest sleep tech. This is something really, really important and to get it right it merits clinical help and what solves insomnia problems best is something called cognitive behavioural therapy.
(07:24) because you use strategies to deal with that mental preoccupation to help get the sleep pattern back into a normal rhythm and to allow sleep to happen naturally. CBTI works by changing the thoughts and habits that might be making sleep difficult and can prevent the negative patterns that stop us sleeping.
(07:44) CBTI is really good for treating insomnia. There's a wealth of clinical literature that's showing this to be an effective way of helping people sleep better. Unfortunately in the UK, it's not as widely available as I'd like it to be, and I think as everyone would like it to be, but it's worth looking out for the treatment whether that's provided through digital medicine, through psychological therapy services or through some other means.
(08:09) It's CBTI that you're looking for. If this is something that we know works, why it is that it isn't more widely available? I think GPs are clearly under a huge amount of pressure these days. We haven't got enough GPs in the NHS and I think coupled with the fact that sleep medicine is a relatively new field, clinically speaking, and it hasn't drawn the kind of attention that other things have and we're beginning to recognise it as a legitimate complaint.
(08:37) I need more sleep because I'd like to be a happy person and fulfilling my potential. Bye. Going into this process, I thought that I knew everything there was to know about insomnia. I've also realised that I had basically given up hope of ever changing it but actually this isn't the way it has to be.
(09:00) I've decided to take it more seriously because it is a genuine condition and I'm now going forward going to treat it as such and for the first time, basically in my life, I've got hope that potentially this could change for me.

Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that can make it hard to fall asleep or stay asleep. It also can cause you to wake up too early and not be able to get back to sleep. You may still feel tired when you wake up. Insomnia can drain your energy level and affect your mood. It also can affect your health, work performance and quality of life.

How much sleep is enough varies from person to person. But most adults need 7 to 9 hours a night.

At some point, many adults have short-term insomnia. This can last for days or weeks. Short-term insomnia is usually due to stress or a distressing event. But some people have long-term insomnia, also called chronic insomnia. This lasts for three months or more. Insomnia may be the main problem, or it may be related to other medical conditions or medicines.

You do not have to put up with sleepless nights. Simple changes in your daily habits often can help.

Insomnia symptoms may include:

If insomnia makes it hard for you to do daily activities, see your doctor or another primary care professional. Your doctor will search for the cause of your sleep problem and help treat it. If it's thought that you could have a sleep disorder, your doctor might suggest going to a sleep center for special testing.

Insomnia may be the main problem or it may be related to other conditions.

Nearly everyone has an occasional sleepless night. But you're more likely to have insomnia if:

Sleep is as important to your health as a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Whatever is keeping you from sleeping, insomnia can affect you mentally and physically. People with insomnia report a lower quality of life compared with people who sleep well.

Wanting to fall asleep but not being able to is an incredibly frustrating experience. It’s also an extremely common one. In fact, doctors are seeing this type ofinsomniaso frequently these days, it’s like an epidemic, saysJoanne Pizzino, MD, MPH, a physician with Parsley Health. “The more stressful the world we live in, the more it affects our sleep,” she adds.

If you’re wondering why it’s so bad for your health when you can’t fall asleep, the answer lies with the autonomic nervous system. It runs everything in the background, Dr. Pizzino explains: beats your heart, controls your blood pressure, makes hormones, and digests your food.

The system has two branches: the sympathetic nervous system (also known as the “fight or flight” response), and the parasympathetic nervous system (also known as the “rest and digest” impulse).

The sympathetic nervous system is only supposed to be activated for short periods of time when we experience a threat, with the majority of our time spent in the parasympathetic state. “But in our modern world, we tend to be in this 24/7 turn-on-the-sympathetic-nervous-system thing due to stress and other factors,” Dr. Pizzino says.

To understand how this affects our health, a quick example is helpful:

“When a gazelle is running away from a lion, it doesn’t stop and take a nap,” Dr. Pizzino says. “It doesn’t stop and digest its food. It doesn’t stop and make a baby.” The gazelle uses the rush of adrenaline from the sympathetic nervous response to get away from the lion. “And then if you actually watch the gazelle once it’s safe, it’ll stomp the ground and shake, because it has to discharge this enormous amount of energy that it just used to save its life.” That’s the sympathetic nervous system shutting down, making room for the parasympathetic nervous system to do its thing.

But most people never “discharge” that sympathetic energy, which means we aren’t nearly as effective at the activities we’re supposed to do in the parasympathetic state. Many of these activities happen while we’re asleep, or can’t happen unless we get enough sleep such as reproducing, boosting our own immunity, digesting our food, and making the hormones our bodies need in the right amounts.

Not being able to fall asleep in particular is a pretty reliable sign that the sympathetic nervous system is out of whack. It can also set off a chain reaction and self-perpetuating cycle: trouble falling asleep means not enough sleep, which means the body isn’t recovering or working the way it’s supposed to, which in turn makes it harder to calm down and fall asleep.

Ahead, Dr. Pizzino breaks down why you can’t fall asleep at night, plus what to do about it.

When a patient can’t fall asleep, Dr. Pizzino first asks about what they’re doing in the hours leading up to bedtime. “Sometimes, people are staying up and answering emails and things like that because they know they don’t fall asleep, so they know they need to occupy themselves until they get tired.”

Especially for parents with young children, people sometimes stay up to get important tasks done before bed. Then, they find themselves having trouble going to sleep when they’ve finished, “So teasing out how much of staying up is voluntary and how much of it is something physiologic going on can be important,” Dr. Pizzino adds.

If after reflection, you discover this is your problem, finding another time to do these tasks and/ordeveloping a nighttime routinecan help.

You probably know that you’re supposed to go to bed and wake up around the same time every day. This isn’t always easy to achieve, but the more regular you can get, the better, Dr. Pizzino says. If you’re consistent enough with your bedtime, your body will eventually learn when it’s supposed to fall asleep.

For those trying to adjust their sleep schedules to be more regular, it’s important to do it gradually, Dr. Pizzino says. So if you normally fall asleep at 1 am, but you’re looking to change to 10 pm, start by adjusting your bedtime to 12:30 am. Then, gradually push your bedtime 30 minutes earlier every one or two weeks.

Naps can also have an impact on your ability to fall asleep. Some people may find power naps (ones lasting less than 30 minutes) to be helpful, but anything longer than that is likely to make it difficult for you to fall asleep at night, Dr. Pizzino says, so for most people, long naps should be avoided. If you find naps are necessary because you’retired all the time, there may be something deeper going on.

If you feel exhausted but can’t sleep, this might be the issue you’re dealing with. “We call it wired and tired,” Dr. Pizzino says. “This is probably the most common thing I see with patients who can’t fall asleep.”

We already covered how stress affects the autonomic nervous system. “Part of that is what’s called the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, or HPA-axis,” Dr. Pizzino explains. The hypothalamus, a part of your brain, and the pituitary gland control the adrenals, which producecortisol, our stress hormone. “Cortisol goes up in response to physical, mental, and emotional stress,” Dr. Pizzino explains. Increased cortisol makes it even harder to get into that “rest and digest” state, making it difficult to fall asleep.

If your doctor suspects this may be your issue, they can test your levels with a4-point cortisol testthat measures your cortisol levels throughout the day. For optimal sleep, your levels should be lowest when it’s time for bed. If that’s not the case, Parsley Health’s doctors and health coaches work with members tonaturally lower your cortisol levels.

“Chronic inflammationis probably the biggest health issue in the modern world,” Dr. Pizzino says. ”When we’re inflamed, the body sees that as an alarm system.”

If you think back to the example earlier, we mentioned that the gazelle doesn’t make a baby while running away from the lion. “Our sex hormones andthyroidhormones are among of the first things that are impacted in a sympathetic state, Dr. Pizzino says. This can causehormone imbalances, which can play into energy levels and circadian rhythm, potentially wreaking havoc on our ability to fall asleep.

One hormonal imbalance that especially affects the ability to fall asleep is low progesterone in menstruating women (which can happen alongside higher-than-normal estrogen levels). “Progesterone, which is a calming hormone, is the direct precursor to cortisol. So when we’re under a lot of physical, mental, or emotional stress, we often don’t have enough progesterone,” Dr. Pizzino says.

If you notice sleep issues that coincide with your menstrual cycle, that’s a red flag that this may be an issue for you. If you're inperimenopause or menopause, hormone deficiencies may also be at the root of sleep issues.

Your doctor can help youget your hormone levels checked. They’ll also advise you on changes like diet andexercisemodifications that can help get hormones back to their normal levels.

The HPA-axis can also get out of whack due to physical stress, and one physical stressor that people often miss is hidden infections and viruses. Everything from parasitic infections to tick-borne diseases, viruses in the herpes family such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and the herpes zoster virus can cause undue stress on the body, Dr. Pizzino says.

These are referred to as “hidden” because they’re really good at avoiding theimmune system, which makes diagnosis and treatment tricky. Aside from having trouble falling asleep due to revved-up cortisol, the most common sign this could be an issue, according to Dr. Pizzino, is not feeling rested even when you do get enough sleep. Other signs include flu-like symptoms in the absence of a fever,brain fog, and musculoskeletal pain (which may also make it difficult to fall asleep).

“Digestive issues contribute immensely to problems falling asleep,” Dr. Pizzino says. In particular, eating too much too close to bedtime is problematic. Because of our circadian rhythm, we’re really not supposed to be digesting after about 8 p.m at the latest, according to Dr. Pizzino. Of course, feeling uncomfortably full could be contributing to why you can’t fall asleep. But there’s another reason it’s best to have an earlier dinner: “When we eat late at night, it literally pulls blood away from the brain and other places that are supposed to be working while we sleep.” That might make it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep.

One way to improve your ability to fall asleep is to try out a12-hour overnight fasting window. So for example, that would mean finishing up dinner by 7pm and eatingbreakfastat 7am.

Gut healthgets a lot of attention, for good reason. A lot of important neurotransmitters—chemical messengers in your nervous system—such as serotonin and GABA, are made in your gut. “GABA is particularly important for sleep because it’s the only calming chemical in the brain,” Dr. Pizzino explains. “When we don’t have enough GABA, that’s when we getanxietyand have trouble sleeping.”

When your microbiome is out of balance, with more “unfriendly” flora than “friendly” flora, your body literally sees that as a threat, Dr. Pizzino says. “Are you going to be able to fall asleep if you think that there’s something dangerous out there? Probably not.”

The good news is that there’s a lot you can do toimprove your gut health, from dietary modifications to taking a proven probiotic, both of which can be done with support from your health care team.

“Alcohol tends to be one of the big slip-ups with sleep because people often use it to help them turn off that sympathetic nervous system and calm down,” Dr. Pizzino says. Because alcohol is an anesthetic, it takes your brain waves down into a more relaxed state. But when that effect wears off, the brain waves start getting overactive again, causing you to become alert. Depending on how you time your alcohol intake, this could either cause you to have a hard time falling asleep, orwake up in the middle of the night.

For this reason, it can help totake a break from alcoholuntil your sleep issues are worked out.

“A lot of people don’t appreciate how much the coffee they drink in the morning is still affecting their body at night,” Dr. Pizzino says. How your body processes caffeineis partially genetic, she explains. Some people are less efficient at it, which means their 10 am latte could really leave them with caffeine lingering in their system well into the evening.

Even for those who do process caffeine well genetically, relying too much on the stuff causes another vicious cycle when it comes to sleep. At 3 or 4pm, you still have some work to do, but you’re tired because you didn’t sleep the night before, so you have some coffee, which then lingers and makes it harder for you to fall asleepthatnight.

If you frequently consume caffeine and can’t fall asleep, Dr. Pizzino recommends experimenting with what happens when you greatly reduce it or completely remove it from your diet. This can be hard to execute, though, because she finds a lot of people don’t give it enough of a chance. That’s because if you’re dependent on caffeine at all, removing it will cause your sympathetic nervous system to go into overdrive temporarily, which might make sleep issues worse at first.

But rest assured, if you stick with it for a week, you’ll be able to decipher whether removing caffeine is helpful for you or not. Parsley’s health coaches often work with people to reduce their caffeine intake gradually and monitor symptoms.

Worrying about not being able to fall asleep is also pretty common, and can exacerbate the primary issue. “People who have trouble falling asleep can get into clock watching and tossing and turning, wondering why they haven’t fallen asleep yet,” Dr. Pizzino says. “Now they’ve added that fear on top of whatever was keeping them from falling asleep.”

This is wherebasic sleep hygienecomes into play: having a dark, quiet, cool room is key, Dr. Pizzino says. These might seem a bit obvious, but they can make a big difference, she adds.

Another core element of sleep hygiene is avoiding blue light before bed, which canblock melatonin production, making it tough to fall asleep. “You really need to turn your screens off one to two hours prior to bed,” Dr. Pizzino says.

If you use your phone as your alarm clock, avoid the temptation to scroll right before bed or go old-school with a traditional alarm clock.

There’s also the idea that electromagnetic fields (EMF) emitted by electronics—such as cell phones and wifi routers—may interfere with sleepby impacting brain waves and therefore messing with our ability to fall and stay asleep. This has the potential to interact with our own electrical system, says Dr. Pizzino. Still, theWorld Health Organizationhas stated, “current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields,” so more research is needed.

For both of these reasons, Dr. Pizzino recommends leaving your phone charging in another room when you sleep—not on your nightstand.

“As far as your body knows, you just ran away from a tiger,” Dr. Pizzino says. “Are you going to be feeling like going to sleep?” Again, the answer is probably not. That’s why she recommends ideally working out earlier in the day, but definitely not within two hours of bedtime.

“Magnesium is probably the number one nutrient deficiency we see,” Dr. Pizzino says. That’s because it’s not found in the soil much anymore, so it’s hard to get from food. “A lot of people really need magnesium supplementation, so it’s one of the best things to try if you’re having trouble falling asleep.” That’s because it supports brain function, and can help support restful sleep.

Just make sure you’re getting an absorbable form: magnesium glycinate, glucarate, aspartate, or threonate. Avoid magnesium citrate and oxide, Dr. Pizzino says. “Those are good for evacuating your bowels, but they’re not so good for helping you sleep.”

If you find that you frequently can’t fall asleep, consider talking to a healthcare provider.Parsley Healthhelps members with sleep issues get to the underlying cause and improve their sleep long term.

Transcript:
(00:00) so when people think of addiction they think of alcoholism heroin addiction crack cocaine but you have a much broader understanding of addiction yes it was shown to me it's that I think it's the relationship between the inner and outerworld and those most obvious things lack of heroin alcoholism substance misuse they are merely the most ever evident form of addiction I think it's an attachment belief that the material and external world can somehow resolve the problems of your inner life put more simply addiction is
(00:37) a behavior that you would like to stop and when you can't when you try to you cannot addiction begins with pain and it ends with pain you are in pain you practice you whatever it is you do to get you away from the pain whether it's pornography or food or sex or drugs and then it leads to more pain and then the cycle begins again so the I'm increasingly as I am talk more about the nature addiction less and less interested in the object it's almost better to be a crackhead because if you are a crack it it's pretty clear what
(01:09) the problem is because you're taking crack so it's a good entry point into the conversation conversation if someone's taking crack and they go a little problem is could it be the crack no only if someone's you know about with it someone codependency toxic relationships work you know it's the you come they'll deny it all the live long day think about it I found myself getting context where various forms of my addictive behavior were lionized you know I go like if you're a 20 year old
(01:39) at drama school in London and you are a heroin addict and you drink that's a advantage people think oh my god this guy he's crazy something yeah and until it's not it's like yeah alright there's a lot of sick everywhere and he's breaking all the windows yeah well there's this subtle insidious form of addiction like perhaps looking at myself in the mirror just wanting to be liked all the time oh boy that's exhausting yeah baby said good isn't it because it's a signal that
(02:05) there something in you that wants to be fed and nurtured and the good news about the 12 steps and this that sounds kind of Christian the goodness is the answers are coming the Lord is present he is within the resurrection will happen and it won't be over there or be in here it will rise again so do you think then that addiction is really sort of a spiritual affliction on some level like because it is so broad and it addresses so many pieces of be of our behavior it's it's in essence like we're chasing
(02:38) this desire this need but it's based in the material world and in the material world can't make us happy so then we just keep going back for more is that so your understanding is that your belief yes yeah and so what then is recovery look like for me recovery looks like the 12 steps it looks like an admission of a problem the belief that the problem and you're actually towards it can change a willingness to accept help both from other people and to hand over your will and your control and in my case a kind
(03:19) of belief in acceptance of a higher power a different type of consciousness it looks like making an inventory and sharing that inventory with someone else being willing to admit that you have problems and being willing to have those problems removed it looks like step seven we're at now being humbly asking for those problems to be removed a sincere commitment to change then the an inventory process that isn't no longer about the self about others people that have been harmed and a willingness to make amends to them and then 10 11 12
(03:50) the final three steps remain conscious and aware all times every your life is in the moment that you're living in step 11 conscious contact of a higher power through prayer meditation we connect with our own understanding of God because in mark as we've discussed already although it may be only in mine available with subtitles that the solution to this problem is a spiritual one a connection to a higher power having had this realization and this African and we're a departure from most insular and I would say somewhat
(04:22) narcissistic theology or practice is pertinent his step 12 having had a spiritual awakening we carry this message and we serve others so for me that's what recovery looks like isn't that there are there are translations and interpretations and there are tweaks but for me the principles not only apply in 12-step methodology but also I've seen comparative ideas in Islam Christianity Buddhism even sort of secular and materialist ideologies in the end that's the be a sort of a new or even psychiatry say an acceptance that
(05:04) there's an aspect of yourself that has to be overcome in right now for you personally are you living in the vibration of step 12 I mean I see what you're doing you're putting yourself out there to essentially help others is that what provides meaning on the other side of recovery I don't see myself as being so far down the path of recovery that I am in this luxurious position of being out help others in many senses I'm in the same position I was in when I was a crack and heroin addict the program
(05:37) works so I continue to work the program I suppose in a way because I've got a particular set of skills I am now allowing those skills with what I've learned I mean post primarily as a communicator are an entertainer communicators a good word to mispronounce huh so um so you know I don't see myself as evolved or advanced beyond the 12 steps because in a sense there was nothing that needed to be evolved or advanced I just needed to recognize that what I thought was a yearning for heroin or other people's
(06:13) approval or fame or money was this requirement for a connection to God as someone a teacher of mine once said all forms of desire are the inappropriate substitute for the desire to be at one with God yeah yeah beautiful it's good isn't it and he told me that I was quite young and it took me ages - listen I was 27 and so you wrote you wrote a quite brilliant book on mentorship Thanks I've enjoyed it I've listened to it in the car on my trips and obviously you've taken this quite seriously because here you are you know
(06:47) working with groups of people on a rather than a regular basis trying to help them essentially realize these things that you have been fortunate in in some ways enough to realise can you talk about the importance of mentorship a bit and how it's baked in to the 12-step what it means for you whilst the twelve steps can be worked in isolation the intention of some of the original forms of literature of 12-step philosophy was that it could be worked in alienation and isolation for people that were just geographically isolated
(07:22) in my experience and I think this is commented people that habit of that program is best worked communally for a number of reasons one the acknowledgement that other people have got lives and problems and the soft belief that your own life and problem is the center of the galaxy is a peculiar if understandable won't do to the way that the senses work and that but particularly having someone as it were upstream a mentor a teacher or in my case more poor but one in particular with the 12-step program is like the
(07:53) acknowledgement that I don't run the show of my life anymore I don't if I'd like you know look all of these things for me is a process of negotiation and going backwards and forwards and thinking no I can do it the old way again I still have the problems that I've always had to a degree that's what's somewhat complex about this philosophy but when I'm afraid or I feel inadequate or like I've got problems and I'm thinking ah this is what I'm gonna do to solve these problems I talk to
(08:21) someone else and I say I've got this problem I'm thinking about doing this what do you think and my sponsor or mentor without fail will say well you know I don't have any advice or an opinion but my experience is that when you do things like this xx xx and it's usually boils down to thunks I can do that you idiot so it's a bit of an ego trip yeah and yeah an ego chicken let sort of an acknowledgment of the limitations of the ego you know of like a bit or you know of maybe I don't know never
(08:54) psychiatry to use the term ego accurately but whatever is this of the parameters the circumference of the ecosystem of my intelligence the kind of decisions that I make the kind of relationships I form the kind of mistakes that I make if I'm to all of that it's good to have some external input one like from people that are further down the path for me people that have been clean and sober for longer than I have and to from a system a program a method that runs at odds and is applicable to my condition but
(09:27) entirely distinct from my condition so when I'm thinking about this is what I want to do I check with a sponsor I check with program you know like what's beautiful about this and as I learn more about it as I'm talk more about it what I recognize is whatever it is that's happening in my life that is problematic for me I can apply this system I can acknowledge there's a problem believe that it can get better ask for help inventory it and see what's going on what patterns of thought and
(09:53) and in our language defects of character have taken part I can make us and see a commitment to change I can list people that I've harmed be willing to make amends to them and the process goes on tends stay aware and let them increase conscious contact of higher power 12 be of service what I feel like the 12-step program does is it rotates you from unconscious unaware and places you in conscious and aware and it does it again and again in the cloudy murky mists of drug addiction to not drug addict obsession with other people's approval
(10:20) to not obsession with other people's approval now something that it's a subtle and as behaviorally and socially acceptable as IPPs and indeed encouraged as other people's approval I can come in and out of that but at least now I know where I'm gonna be and a sponsor and a mentor is a great place to go I've had this experience it made me feel like this and he knows you know where the bodies are buried he's seen my my step four and five he seen my big inventory of my past and he's able to say well if
(10:49) you're thinking of getting into a relationship like this you might want to consider how that compares to this relationship that you were previously in ya know it's interesting I mean once you've done some did work right you've read and you've meditated and you've studied you know that you're that you should be living from this place of love from your infinite soul from your divine nature all the time and you you wake up and you're like okay well I'm gonna do that I'm committed to doing that I know that
(11:16) that's going to bring me true happiness contentedness or at least that's what I think I am but every day we're drawn into this this you know ego vacuum of okay well no actually I am what this person thinks of me I am what I do I am my job I'm disconnected from others I'm in competition from others I'm separate from God and in a way your mentor can check that that behavior yes this is a vital component like it really is to have people that you trust that you've selected you know prudently that have a program
(11:54) of their own because it said I was taught if you of listening to somebody else and what they're telling you doesn't come from the program you're listening to a drug addict you know so me without this program I'm a drug addict that's what I am are my solution to the problems of life I'll take drugs life is painful trust no one take drugs we're for the program I am be of service to others we are all one consciousness I'll be a different person I'm a different person but that guy is
(12:22) still in there you know so like a Churchill said no plan survives human contact so don't be disappointed when this program doesn't immediately turn you into some Francis of Assisi you know I'm still me but what I know is is that I know there's another direction to go in I know that the solution isn't if I can just get everyone to like me then it's going to be okay I've tried that it doesn't work yeah one thing you talked about your met your first mentor I believe his name was chip summers yes
(12:51) Jim and I found it actually really really interesting how you described sort of the ideal conditions were met for mentorship to thrive can you talk about that a little bit like what are those ideal conditions for mentorship to be successful I would have to say that the ideal conditions for mentorship to thrive is surrender and acceptance and honesty open-mindedness and willingness these are the ideal conditions when I'm dealing with people with addiction issues in a sense it becomes a relief once you're in the program once you're
(13:26) on the other side because I go oh you're a heroin addict are you well here are the things you need to do I don't want to do that okay so what about you have you got a problem yeah yeah because like this is not me this is not my idea this is you know relatively new for a theology that's going to become as influential as I believe it's going to become it's you know 70 80 years old it's derived of courses I'm sure you're aware from the theology of William James of Psychiatry of Carl Jung first century
(13:56) Christianity is espoused by like Emma Fox and there was some linguistic and I would say nomenclature problems as a result of that I'm interested in the authoring of the vocabulary so it becomes more appropriate and accessible I'm not about demystification Buttrey mystification God is present in this there's nothing without God in this but it's a heavily heavily car goad word these days yeah I think your point around the attitudes that Amenti must have is honesty open-mindedness willingness you also I think describe
(14:32) the 12-step at least is very conducive to membership to mentorship because there's a clear end result right yeah man I mean there's a clear aim result from taking heroin to not taking heroin is pretty clear and pretty radical transformation if you know just like to be addicted to heroin or anything the other thing is is that there is the whilst the principles can be loosely worn and can be practiced in accordance with the individual to a degree you know they are protein they are not rigid like anything that's real it's got proper
(15:04) balls it's not gonna fall over soon as a stiff breeze it also what I've realised has got built into it a sort of protection against like the cult of personality or whatever you know like me continually I'm acknowledging what oh I know I don't know nothing it's the principles very important they'll notice being as we're having this conversation in Los Angeles that a lot of cults don't go that way well of course start with hey man peace and love and end with let's put some poison in the salad bar a lot of cops
(15:34) start with peace and love and end with I want to have sex with all of the people that are in this cult now what I now know is there a kind of certain absolutes that my job is to be of service to others that I mean I'm gonna spend my whole life being a service hours because I'm flawed but I know that if I'm not being service of others of others the results are not guaranteed now we're out of the territory that I know I'm safe in so if I'm thinking in this situation I want this I want this
(16:01) okay good luck because we've tried that method you know yeah so last John requestion 's because I know that you're hosting a big group I won't talk a little bit about yoga and kind of spiritual and embodied practices because the 12-step was obviously very very influential for you from a spiritual perspective but I wonder what the relationship is between the 12-step in yoga and a little bit about the importance of yoga and your personal healing journey step 11 if the 12 steps is increase conscious contact with God
(16:38) of our understanding the point of yoga is to prepare the body you know I'm talking about asana yoga prepare the body for meditative States so there's an obvious corollary there around step 11 my personal experience is I started doing yoga when I was in treatment to get off drugs the first time like not out of place the place I got clean wasn't that I'm proud to say fancy but like I started doing the yoga classes outside and like so it took over my mom always said you should be doing yoga I've got like sort of dark memories of
(17:11) people always telling me the answer was gonna be meditation for me in spirituality but I ploughed on with that heroin and crack and other people's approval and all that stuff so yoga why I like yoga is because it's an embodied physical practice and this the body it got is part of it and increasingly I think that there's line between consciousness the body the spirit and the mind is an imaginary one I mean I can't find an exact point where neurology is distinct from the nervous yeah I don't know where that
(17:41) line is I don't think there is a line so for me yoga I know your man's into the Kundalini I love that stuff I was well into that for a while but then it is so much lately I've not done as much anything like because I've got two very young daughters and mothers right there yeah for the Pratt for the patients and the surrender yeah there's a lot of that going on I tell you um but what I do like is in some sense he's neglected my body in the first part of my life I didn't know how to inhabit my personal
(18:11) like um like my personal practices now Sam yoga always I'm glad I did enough Ashtanga Yoga that I'm now it's always a place I can go I can practice on my own primary series and if I'm in somewhere that has yoga I like to do yoga with others Kundalini I love it I love the you know the Kundalini experience is like without introducing pharmaceuticals or plant medicines sort of you know I am and there are certain types of refworks and no you're familiar with wim HOF and stuff but I like the Kundalini
(18:40) experience I've had moments of cessation of self like moments of like oh my god I'm not me and then oh no I am me it's me that's remembering I'm not me I've had that induced by Kundalini before so I like it I also like Brazilian Jujitsu that's where I'm a fan and a student of in your country Kiran Gracie and like who is here for this workshop today because like and you know elsewhere Ricardo Wilkin in my country kissed Chris clear all like various black boats under the grey sea
(19:12) system because they were jujitsu for men it puts you in your ball and women for anybody I suppose but I'm talking from a personal perspective like it puts you in your body it for me means contact with people there's got absolutely like this non-sexual submission I mean it's full of so much amazing stuff and I'm very interested in developing that which is curious because it's like it's like I'm a white belt really other side of the room I'm not going to be leaving that particular charge so because you know
(19:42) there was like I think 1.5 million people in the United States anyways that that got into treatment for alcohol and drugs this past year but after 60 days or so there's 80 percent of those people relapse and I wonder if you think maybe the combination of yoga jujitsu physical practices can help sort of stem that relapse because I wonder where we're going wrong a bit I don't know I don't know I would be very open to that and I imagine that you have done more research into that than I ever what I feel is
(20:19) necessary is a deep personal connection with God and for some people there might be people who are physically unable to do yoga and Brazilian Jujitsu and why should they be excluded and I I but for me it's like how are you gonna concede to your innermost self that the or construction that you've been living in is not going to work for you not that you're a bad person you need to be admonished but you've got to get deep part of my deal is yoga part of my deal is Brazilian Jujitsu like but the only things that I would

(00:00) can I just um don't I don't know what to do um um I think I don't know what to say I'm sorry you don't know sometimes what to say and you're basically walking on eggshells sometimes it can shock people if someone says you're having a good day they just expect you to say yes out I'm okay and I'll craft it no I'm not and some people can get taken about oh oh oh and I think there's the fear of saying the wrong thing you know what do I know about Mental Health [Music] I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa
(00:46) body dysmorphic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder back in 2013 and on Friday the 29th of August 2014 I tried to take my own life my name is fakira and I'm sandeep's mom mother is it best friend my best friend their first first tournament session um when he was struggling with his uh with his mental health and uh from there we kind of in a strange way hit it off I think it's love at first sight I like to think I'm Dr will murcott I'm a mental health nurse and Senior lecturer with the open
(01:23) University [Music] for me listening is at the top of the list I think that's the first and most important step if you can active listening repeating back some of the things that they've said to you so that they can feel and realize that they're being helped that first initial conversation that you had with me when my mum and dad sat me down that's when the bubble popped for me that's when I thought at that very moment that someone's noticing how I'm feeling someone is noticing and having an
(02:03) oversight of my pain just asking how you are it was so crucial and so important to me at that moment asked twice you know are you okay yeah I'm all right but no are you really okay and then it's like well no actually I'm not I think there is an urge to try and problem solve and do something and there's almost need some time to be able to fix a problem or a person and sometimes that's not the right thing to do in that situation people aren't necessarily looking for answers people want to be
(02:37) heard one of the things I've learned as a mental or professional is that often if I try and set goals or have my own needs and wants and desires for how somebody should get better they are usually wrong and so from my point of view is is working with a person at their pace and trying to understand how they want to move you can suggest go to your GP you can suggest support groups you can suggest people taking an activity you can go and join in that activity with them so it's they're not feeling an alone with that one size does
(03:19) not fit all you've had a really great idea didn't you the Family Trust yeah cool so what we do we go at the family environment and go to a coffee shop or or just sit there all four of us actually doing our pause and next what's been your positive for the whole month what's been your negative we spend a lot of time insulting each other we just send each other little videos or oh yeah I've been watching that and just little Clips everybody's at the click of a button now you're in my pocket yeah
(03:55) if they're really struggling and at Breaking Point emergency um phone lines out there and Samaritans as well they need to know that there is support out there and it's so hard so hard to see that when you are in a dark place when you're in a dark place yeah one of the scary things is that kind of pressure of what what do I do if because it could be nothing more scary than having somebody talk to you about ending their life harming themselves in some way really the person needs to know as well at what
(04:36) points you'll find something acceptable or unacceptable and then have to do something or involves somebody else I always try and get that conversation done as soon as I can to say look you know I will never breach your confidence but if there are things that worry me then I may have to do something about that and again that's absolutely okay because a person will thank you for it afterwards let people know that I'm here and we're gonna do this together so if that means right if me and you we're
(05:10) going to make an appointment at the GP we'll go together and we'll do this together and it's that about it's about being in the mud together you have to keep your own emotional batteries charged up because when then drained out you can't help anybody else and you struggle to function let alone just trying to look after yourself the plane and the oxygen mask put your oxygen mask on first uh self-care is is the number one priority I think so I don't think you can actually fail and that's something that I would really
(05:46) push to everyone who's helping someone with mental health struggles is you haven't failed you cannot fail but you can do something trust again trust your instincts be yourself the right thing is probably what you first felt and that could have been sitting and listening just nodding or it could have been responding tell me more about that so not too over worry not to overthink but there is support out there there are people that will listen to you and give you advice and guidance and it's important to talk oh my God it's so
(06:23) important to talk very important to talk we we had most chats with lovely man you know it's yeah it's good to it's good to have someone like Josh in my life it makes my life better [Music] thank you [Music]








It’s increasingly common for someone to be diagnosed with a condition such as ADHD or autism as an adult. A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers.

It can be challenging to love someone who has an addiction—painful to observe their loss of control and accruing harm, painful to experience the “disappearance” of the person you care about, and painful to withstand the many deceits that usually accompany addiction. Still, it is possible to help someone get out of the trap of addiction, although that usually takes time, many tries, many disappointments, and a clear understanding of how addiction works and, especially, how it robs substance users of the ability to control their use even when they want to do so.

Social drinking can easily slide into problem drinking without fanfare, but there are signs that should raise red flags. Obviously, frequently appearing intoxicated should set off alarms. Drinking that starts early in the day or before social functions is a warning sign, as is hiding one’s drinking. Failing to meet obligations or sleeping through appointments is another serious sign, and such lapses may have repercussions such as problems at work or school. Alcohol use disorder also frequently manifests in problems of remembering or thinking. Questions about drinking may be met with anger, defensiveness, or denial.

Many teens experiment with alcohol. The vast majority of them do not become addicted. TheSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration(SAMHSA) describes a number of signs suggesting a child is abusing alcohol. They include:

Drug use becomes a problem when a person can no longer control use and the use interferes with functioning. Use is marked by shifts in behavior than can vary widely among individuals. Acute intoxication—slurred, slowed, or disjointed speech; perceptual disturbances; sudden mood shifts; disrupted thinking patterns; an “absent presence”—can be obvious. But other signs can be more subtle and develop over time. They include:

• Disinterest or difficulties in school or declining performance at work

• Changes in social patterns, sets of friends, or the onset of interpersonal problems

• Withdrawal from activities once enjoyed

• Secretiveness about activities and relationships

• Loss of energy or motivation

• Neglect of physical appearance and hygiene

• Lying about whereabouts

• Personality changes such as unpredictable displays of hostility, suspicion, or irritability, or rapid mood swings

• Stealing money or valuables to pay for drugs

• Becoming defensive or lashing out when questioned about drug use.

It is difficult for those addicted to see beyond the craving and momentary pleasures, to envision functioning without their drug, yet important for their future to have a powerful positive incentive to do so. Lectures and confrontational techniques are usually ineffective and often damage relationships that could be levers of change. What’s needed is an approach that ismore collaborative than confrontational—reaching toward a goal everyone can be happy with.

Having a calm, respectful conversation about concerns—while setting boundaries about substance use, such as no alcohol or drugs are allowed in the house, not being allowed in the house when intoxicated——demonstrates caring. And such discussions could borrow the insights ofmotivational interviewing, a conversational technique that counselors use to help a person find and bolster their internal motivation to give up drug use and act on their deepest values and dreams for themselves. Easily adapted for everyday use, it’s an approach that respects a person’s struggles while inspiring them to make a change.

A noticeable drop in job performance. Long disappearances. Erratic behavior. Absences. Excuses. Disorganization. Frequent errors. These are signs that a colleague or supervisor might be using alcohol or drugs. Many opt to keep their concerns about a colleague quiet, lest the person lose his or her job. A better option is to have a talk with the coworker privately—but only if you keep the tone supportive and not at all confrontational. It should convey concern and the desire to help, while noting the changes in job performance. Be prepared, though, for the possibility that your colleague will dismiss your concern. Still, it’s important to let the person know you are receptive to talking any time.

The best option, however, depending on the industry and the size of the company, is to document the problematic behavior and bring the evidence to the attention of both your supervisor and the human resources department. Many companies have programs specifically designed to help such employees while protecting their job.

It’s important to remember that no one expects to get addicted. Forcing someone to admit to a problem is not the wisest way to encourage someone to stop using the problematic substance or behavior. Confrontation generally leads to defensiveness and denial. Instead, the goal is to quietly remove the many psychological barriers that keep a person from taking steps to overcome addiction. And then to help them find their own motivation to change.

A good start is to understand how addiction works, and that should encourage anyone to develop and displaycompassion for the loved onetrapped in substance abuse. That approach acknowledges the loved one’s suffering, conveys caring and love and reduces the person’s shame—both lessening the need for denial and removing major obstacles to seeking treatment. A next step is to open the door to a calm, respectful conversation about your concerns and your loved one’s deep values and goals in life.

Of course, you have to find the right moment for the conversation, and it is definitely not when your loved one is high or hung over. Confine your concerns to what is observable—“You haven’t slept in days.” “You don’t answer calls from friends.” “You haven’t shown up at practice.” One conversation is not likely to turn things around, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t having an effect. Whatever you say,never call someone an “alcoholic” or addict.” It’s not just a stigmatizing put-down, it actually limits how people can see themselves. It conveys the expectation that they can never change. And makes people feel helpless.

The best time to help someone you love seek treatment is the moment you notice the person is having trouble controlling substance use. While treatment is possible at every stage of addiction severity and it is never easy, early action is the wisest course and spares everyone the significant harm, distress and disruption that may develop otherwise. There is amyth that people have to hit rock bottom—when their health, their livelihood, their relationships are destroyed—before they develop the motivation to change.

For most people, long before that, addiction becomes a trap that no longer provides the rewards it once did, and they are stuck in place, craving the very thing that tightens the trap. The fact is, people can be responsive to change if approached in an understanding and respectful way by concerned loved ones.

Experts agree that two of the most important tools for helping a loved one with an addiction problem are compassion and understanding that the very essence of addiction is increasingly dysregulated control over one’s behavior. Compassion acknowledges a person’s pain and conveys caring and love; it reduces the person’s shame, which removes a major obstacle to seeking help.

Armed with compassion, it is possible to hold a calm, respectful conversation with your loved one about your concerns. The same conversation can awaken or fortify the motivation for change by asking your loved one about his or her deepest values and dreams for life. It will likely take many more than one conversation. But that doesn’t mean the message is lost.

Another important tool is education about treatment possibilities. There are many routes to recovery, many types of treatment programs in many types of settings, and a discussion of recovery options can help your loved one find a pathway that is most in keeping with personal needs and goals.

Informing yourself about the array of treatment possibilities can be extremely useful in helping a loved one decide on an appropriate course of action when the desire for change arises or the need for help in putting a life back together is acknowledged.Residential, inpatient treatment programs—what’s known as “rehab”—are in the news when a celebrity has an addiction problem, but they are by no means the only form of treatment.

People embark on the road to recovery from addiction every day. Only a small proportion of people—from 5 to 10 percent—do it with the help of any type of clinical service or facility. Many people choose to free themselves of addiction through the support of peers, in self-help or mutual support groups. Many people choose to do it on their own. Just as there is no one pathway into addiction, there is no one pathway out of it.

If ultimatums—“Stop the drinking or I’m leaving and taking the kids.” “Straighten out or you’re fired.”—were all it took to get a person to stop harmful substance use, and they worked every time, this question would never arise. Ultimatums are not only alienating, they are no match for drug craving, an immediate, powerful force to continue use. Most often they are heard as hollow threats spoken in momentary anger, an expression of frustration.

Yet, if delivered in a calm, meaningful, and respectful way, theycanspur change; the possibility of loss of a valuable relationship often does lead a person to embark on recovery. Studies show that many individuals entering addiction treatment programs have received an ultimatum stemming from either employment, legal, medical, or family sources. More men (and younger people of both sexes) act on ultimatums from a family member. Women (and older people) often act on a medical ultimatum.

The short answer to the dilemma of what to do when a person refuses to get help for an addiction problem is, never give up hope. Periodically, convey your concerns in a kind and respectful conversation and encourage your loved one to get help. Remember, however, that change is a long-term process, much of it occurring internally, and it can take time for the motivation for change to build to the point of taking noticeable action.

In the meantime, establish boundaries of acceptable behavior and consequences of unacceptable behavior inside the family. Educate yourself about addiction, how it changes people, and what treatment possibilities exist. And take care of yourself. Therapy for yourself can not only keep you sane and available to everyone else in the family but also provide guidance for helping your loved one.

It is a myth that the desperation of hitting rock bottom is the only way to get people to accept the need for change—or believe that they can. Too often, rock bottom is a point at which irreversible damage has occurred—careers, livelihoods, relationships derailed. The problem is that themyth of rock bottomsees people as hopeless, and seeing people as hopeless makes them feel hopeless about themselves. Addiction is not easy to overcome, but the first step on the road to recovery is awareness that it is a possibility.

Too often, efforts to help one troubled member of the family consume all the oxygen in the home. It’s challenging—but necessary for everyone’s well-being—to maintain family functions and routines as much as possible. It can also be helpful to explain to others in the household, in an age-appropriate way not overloaded with detail, that Dad or Sis is struggling with a problem.

It is always necessary in families to set boundaries, ground rules of behavior. But it is especially necessary in the case of addiction, both to preserve the continued development of the rest of the family and to let the struggling person know what is acceptable and what is not. Such expectations also let the loved one know they are welcome when standards are met.

Boundaries can be agreed upon ina conversation with the addicted loved one. They commonly include such rules as:

• No alcohol and other drugs allowed in the house

• Not allowed in the house when intoxicated

• No alcohol or other drug-using friends allowed in the house

• No personal communication when intoxicated (i.e., no calls, texts, etc.)

• No asking to borrow things (e.g. money, car, cell phone, etc.).

It’s increasingly common for someone to be diagnosed with a condition such as ADHD or autism as an adult. A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers.


The National Institute of Healthclaimsthat 10% of US adults will experience a drug disorder at some point in their lives. The agency also details  that three in four of those adults report not receiving any form of treatment. Drug addiction is prevalent in day-to-day life, and it’s never easy to witness someone you know become part of a statistic. However, it’s not easy to help a friend through drug addiction.

It’s no secret that addiction affects more than the user, and sometimes it’s difficult to know where to start when addressing a loved one about such a sensitive topic. Addiction bleeds into relationships with friends and family, and love and support are vital for your friend’s healthy road to recovery. Here are a few ways of how you can help them with their addiction.

The first step in aiding your friend through substance abuse is taking care of yourself. Assisting someone through addiction recovery can be difficult enough, but failing to balance this support with your own struggles will only exacerbate the problem. A few ways to keep your own mental health strong include avoiding self-criticism, continuing to partake in your favorite hobbies, taking care of your body, and learning to manage your stress. (For more ways on maintaining mental health, visit thisarticlefrom The University of Michigan.) And remember, be sure to keep your own health a priority before reaching out to aid a loved one.

Before you can help with substance abuse, you need to recognize thesigns of addiction. Sometimes research can become overwhelming, so a good place to start is by asking yourself these questions:

These questions will guide you in recognizing some of the harmful behaviors of addiction. Once you can establish whether your loved one exhibits these qualities or habits, then consider moving forward to confront the issue. However, addressing someone’s addiction can lead to distrust in a relationship, so be cautious in the way you approach this conversation.

The goal of an intervention is to approach your loved one with the option of seeking treatment, but there are a few things to consider before addressing addiction in this way. Most “tough love” interventions depicted in the media aren’t always the best method of convincing a loved one to seek treatment. At Sprout, we’ve compiled alistof different types of interventions that may benefit your unique situation, but here are a few overall tips to keep in mind:

There’s a good chance if your friend battles substance abuse, he or she may also be battling a mental disorder. Aco-occurring disorder, once known as a dual diagnosis, is a “presence of a mental illness, personality disorder, or addiction alongside a substance abuse disorder.” It is common for someone diagnosed with a mental disorder to develop addictive habits, and vice versa: it’s common for those struggling with substance abuse to undergo psychological stress. This information is important to understand when dealing with addiction, because it can address the root of a problem the patient may have never known about.

Often times people relapse because they never address the underlying mental issues that accompany their addiction, or develop healthy tools to cope. Understanding co-occurring disorders can offer relief to those who have struggled with treatment in the past. They receive answers and a means to overcome both the physical and mental repercussions of addiction. One common way to tackle the psychological stresses of substance abuse is through cognitive behavioral therapy. Encouraging this kind of therapy after a detox program is one way to help your loved one.

Sometimes the road to addiction recovery requires more than just a detox. Co-occurring disorders are very common with substance abusers. In fact, agovernment studyhas shown that half of the people diagnosed with substance abuse also suffer from a mental disorder, and the best way to treat these clients include a combination of physical and mental treatments.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) focuses on the psychological side of addiction and combats the negative thoughts and behaviors that lead to substance abuse. This form of therapy gives clients the tools they need to manage anxiety and stress, which can be especially helpful for those with co-occurring disorders. Addiction often stems from harmful thoughts that lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as drug or alcohol abuse, but CBT teaches ways to actively stride toward ahealthier mindsetthat steers away from dwelling on past behaviors.

Here are the 5 phases used in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy:

Family therapy is another great way to help a loved one with addiction. This is a type of therapy that specifically includes involvement from an individual’s family and friends. In this context, family can involve blood relatives or chosen loved ones—either way, it requires support from every member to help guide the recovery process. This type of therapy acknowledges everybody who can be affected by addiction and opens a bridge for conversation.

Family therapy also allows a greater sense of trust and a chance to re-build relationships that might have been damaged throughout the period of substance abuse. It provides a better sense of community for the individual undergoing treatment and show that they are not facing treatment alone.

While cognitive behavioral therapy and family therapy are just two options, it is recommended that an individual participate in a combination of therapies to increase their chances of recovery.

Sometimes the most daunting part about treatment can be the expenses. Many people fear that they cannot afford the proper attention they deserve, but there are always options. At Sprout, we offer a number of ways to manage finances. Don’t have insurance? Research the next Open Enrollment period through your state’s health plan to see if your loved one has better options. If you’re a parent, you may be able to add a dependent on your current plan.

Our professionals might also recommend alternatives to insurance such as loans and financial aid, so be sure to explore different options before deciding you can’t seek treatment. Recovering from substance abuse is difficult enough—stressing about financial stability should be the least of your worries.

Integrating back into normal life is one of the most difficult parts of recovery, and returning to a home environment can often trigger addictive behaviors. Recovering addicts may experience difficult feelings when they encounter places or people that were once related to their addiction. This is a pivotal time for any recovering addict, and they will need your help now more than ever. Take them out to dinner, introduce them to a new hobby—find a way to replace old habits with new ones. Encouraging continued treatment and recovery support, such as through Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous, can give your loved one added support.

Stress also plays a large part in relapse. This is where friends and family members will reap the benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy, which can team them strategies to manage their stress and discover new coping mechanisms. Everyone has their own unique ways in which they handle stress, but a fewrecommendationsfrom Harvard can help you find relaxation techniques and set realistic goals.

The pathway to healing and recovery is often a journey that can progress over multiple years.Addictionnot only involves the individual suffering from the substance use disorder, but their partner, their family, and their friends as well.

When supporting a partner or family member who is in active addiction toalcoholor other drugs, it’s critically important that you also take care of your well-being. It is a balancing act of offering support to your partner (or friend or family member) in navigating the treatment and recovery options available, while at the same time not losing sight of what you need to be happy and healthy.

Find 8 tips below for how to balance supporting the positive health behaviors of your partner, while also taking care of yourself.

It is important to set ground rules for your relationship, especially when you believe your partner may be developing or actively suffering from a substance use disorder.Boundariesare clearly outlined expectations or rules set forth so that both partners know what behaviors are acceptable.

This avoids the potential for unwittingly positively reinforcing substance use, and can help to avoid feeling constantly frustrated or angry with your significant other’s behavior—angry at being taken advantage of financially, manipulated emotionally, or helpless in the face of the substance use disorder.

Setting boundaries protects your personal health and well-being, is more likely to help your addicted loved one, and can help ensure that you’ll be satisfied with the relationship as well.

Some examples of common boundaries (that can be agreed upon through discussion with your addicted loved one) include:

“Put your own oxygen mask on first before helping others.” You won’t be able to help your partner if you can’t help yourself. Try to maintain your own self-care routines as much as possible. This will build resiliency.

An important first step in helping your partner is understanding their substance use. Educate yourself onsubstance use disorders and available resources. By doing this, you are not only empowering yourself to make well-informed decisions, but you are also ready and equipped with information when your partner decides they are ready to seek help.

Some starter research points include:

With theshameandstigmathat goes along with alcohol or other drug addiction, it is easy for affected loved ones to become increasingly secretive and isolated. Seek help and outside advice early and often. Talk to friends, people and family members in recovery who have the lived experience of what you’re going through, and seek the help of addiction specialists.

When asking for and seeking help, there are several different options available:

Comorbidityis the occurrence of two or more disorders or illnesses in the same person. According to theNational Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the likelihood of a mental illness diagnosis doubles for individuals suffering from a substance use disorder. Your partner may be more willing to talk about theirdepressionoranxietywith you or a professional than talk directly about their substance use. This can be a way for them to get some kind of help that can ultimately lead to positive changes in their alcohol/drug use.

Substance use disorders affect biological functioning, dominating the brain’s reward system, affectingemotional regulation,motivation, impulse control, and pleasure-seeking behaviors. The brain and body become dependent on an outside substance to create feelings ofhappinessand well-being—and, at advanced stages of the disease, to simply maintain the ability to function.

Compulsive behaviorsand the need for rapid reward are likely to surface and intensify as the substance use disorder progresses. Even when an individual detoxifies from a substance, the reward system in the brain can remain changed for a long period of time.

New research is suggesting that due to these changes in the brain, immediate rewards may be a more effective means by which to promote early recovery and your partner’s sobriety. Instead of planning long-term incentives such as a vacation the following year, try planning small immediate rewards each day, and around upcoming weekends, for any positive changes (e.g., keeping to a boundary [see above], talking openly about problems, attending a therapy session etc.).

The immediacy and consistency of positive rewards for any movement in a healthy direction has been shown to shape behavior in addictive individuals that can increase the odds of recovery.

Expect recovery, but be prepared forrelapse. Although some individuals achieve long-term recovery on their first attempt, for others, it may take multiple attempts over multiple years. Keep your hopes up, as substance use disorder is known as a "good prognosis disorder" in that the majority of people can and do recover.

Sometimes, no matter what you do to support your partner, their substance use has progressed to the point where they are unable to make rational decisions to cease their substance use. It may be necessary to seek legal assistance to save your loved one's life. Partners can look into civil commitment laws (e.g. sectioning) within their state, to explore involuntarily sending your partner to treatment. If you feel like you may be in danger of harm, or feel that your relationship is no longer healthy, it may be necessary to seek an end to the relationship.

Transcript:
(00:00) we can all have a bad night of sleep and that's perfectly normal but how can we try to improve both the quantity and the quality of our sleep [Music] here are six scientifically grounded tips for better sleep the first tip is regularity go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time regularity is king and it will actually anchor your sleep and improve both the quantity and the quality no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend or even if you've had a bad night of sleep and the reason
(00:40) is because deep within your brain you actually have a master 24-hour clock it expects regularity and works best under conditions of regularity including the control of your sleep wake schedule many of us use an alarm to wake up but very few of us use a tibetal arm and that's something that can be helpful the next tip is temperature keep it cool it turns out that your brain and your body need to drop their core temperature by about one degree celsius or around two to three degrees fahrenheit in order to initiate sleep and then to stay asleep
(01:22) and this is the reason that you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot so the current recommendation is to aim for a bedroom temperature of around about 65 degrees fahrenheit or a little over 18 degrees celsius it sounds cold but cold it must be the next tip is darkness we are a dark deprived society and in fact we need darkness specifically in the evening to trigger the release of a hormone called melatonin a melatonin helps regulate the healthy timing of our sleep in the last hour before bed try to
(02:05) stay away from all of those computer screens and tablets and phones dim down half the lights in your house you'd actually be quite surprised at how sleepy that can make you feel if you'd like you can wear an eye mask or you can have blackout shades and that will help best regulate that critical sleep hormone of melatonin the next tip is walk it out don't stay in bed awake for long periods of time and the general rule of thumb is if you've been trying to fall asleep and it's been 25 minutes or so or you've
(02:42) woken up and you can't get back to sleep after 25 minutes the recommendation is to get out of bed and go and do something different and the reason is because your brain is an incredibly associative device the brain has learned the association that the bed is this trigger of wakefulness and we need to break that association and by getting out of bed you can go and do something else only return to bed when you're sleepy and in that way gradually your brain will relearn the association that your bed is this place
(03:18) of sound and consistent sleep the fifth tip is something that we've actually already spoken about in detail in this series which is the impact of alcohol and caffeine so a good rule of thumb here is to try to stay away from caffeine in the afternoon and in the evening and certainly try not to go to bed too tipsy the final tip have a wind down routine i think many of us in the modern world we expect to be able to dive into bed at night switch off the light and we think that sleep is also just like a light switch that we should
(03:56) immediately be able to fall asleep well unfortunately sleep isn't quite like that for most of us sleep as a physiological process is much more similar to landing a plane it takes time for your brain to gradually descend down onto the firm bedrock of good sleep in the last 20 minutes before bed or the last half an hour even the last hour disengage from your computer and your phone and try to do something relaxing find out whatever works for you and when you have found it stick to that routine the last thing i should note is that if
(04:37) you are suffering from a sleep disorder for example from insomnia or sleep apnea then these tips aren't necessarily going to help you if i was your sports coach i could give you all of these tips to improve your performance but if you have a broken ankle it's not going to make a difference we have to treat the broken ankle first before we can get back to improving the quality of your performance and it's the same way with sleep so if you think you have a sleep disorder just go and speak with your
(05:09) doctor that's the best piece of advice where do we stand then in all of this conversation about sleep well i think the evidence is clear we can think of sleep almost like a life support system in fact some may even call sleep a superpower



SLEEP HYGIENE - ITS IMPORTANCE & METHODS TO PRACTICE GOOD SLEEP HYGIENE - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) Hello everyone - welcome to medsimplified. Hygiene A small word. Most of us, when we hear this word, think about our daily routine of bathing, changing into fresh clean clothes, cleaning our rooms etc to be hygiene. Over thousands of years, humanity has evolved to a point where hygiene is a must, rather than just an add on. It prevents diseases, improves quality of life and makes us more presentable to the society. But what If I told you, most of us fail to recognise and maintain a very distinct yet important type of hygiene. I’m doctor Umar Malik and in this video, we’ll be talking about - Sleep hygiene. The 1st question that pops up is – what is sleep hygiene? Well, Sleep hygiene consists of environmental changes and overall habits that pave the way for higher-quality sleep and overall better health. Good sleep hygiene is all about putting yourself in the best position to sleep well each and every night. Why sleep hygiene? Obtaining healthy sleep is important for both physical and mental health. It improves productivity and overall quality of life. Everyone, from children to older adults, benefit from better sleep, and sleep hygiene plays a key part in achieving that goal. Research has demonstrated that good sleep is a central part of health. Crafting sustainable and beneficial routines will make healthy behaviour automatic and creates an ongoing process of positive reinforcement. On the flip side, bad habits can become somewhat permanent and they cause negative consequences. We all of suffered from sleepless nights at one point of our life or the other – wondering what it would take to finally fall asleep and wake up fresh. Various studies worldwide have shown that almost 1 in every 3 person suffers from sleep related problems worldwide. This is a very significantly ignored problem. Improving sleep hygiene has little cost and virtually no risk, which makes it an important part of a strategy to counteract the serious problems of insufficient sleep and insomnia. So, let’s begin with a few Signs of Poor Sleep Hygiene. Having a hard time falling asleep experiencing frequent sleep disturbances suffering daytime sleepiness these are tell-tale signs of poor sleep hygiene. And the long-term consequences of this include – having concentration and memory problems Lower performance on the job or at school Slowed reaction time while driving and a higher risk of accidents Increased risk of Mental health disorders, such as depression, an anxiety disorder or substance abuse Increased risk and severity of long-term diseases or conditions, such as high blood pressure and heart disease S0, How Do You Practice Good Sleep Hygiene? Optimizing your sleep schedule, pre-bed routine, and daily routines is part of harnessing habits to make quality sleep feel more automatic. At the same time, creating a pleasant bedroom environment can be an invitation to relax and doze off. A handful of tips can help in each of these areas. You can adapt them to fit your circumstances and create your own sleep hygiene checklist to help get the best sleep possible. Number 1. Set Your Sleep Schedule Having a set schedule normalizes sleep as an essential part of your day and gets your brain and body accustomed to getting the full amount of sleep that you need. Have a Fixed Wake-Up Time: Regardless of whether it’s a weekday or weekend, try to wake up at the same time since a fluctuating schedule keeps you from getting into a rhythm of consistent sleep. Prioritize Sleep: It might be tempting to skip sleep in order to work, study, socialize, or exercise, but it’s vital to treat sleep as a priority. Calculate a target bedtime based on your fixed wake-up time and do your best to be ready for bed around that time each night. Make Gradual Adjustments: If you want to shift your sleep times, don’t try to do it all in one fell swoop because that can throw your schedule out of whack. Instead, make small, step-by-step adjustments of up to an hour or two so that you can get adjusted and settle into a new schedule. Don’t Overdo It with Naps: Naps can be a handy way to regain energy during the day, but they can throw off sleep at night. To avoid this, try to keep naps relatively short and limited to the early afternoon. Number 2. Follow a Nightly Routine How you prepare for bed can determine how easily you’ll be able to fall asleep. A pre-sleep playbook including some of these tips can put you at ease and make it easier to get to fall asleep when you want to. Keep Your Routine Consistent: Following the same steps each night, including things like putting on your comfortable night clothes and brushing your teeth, can reinforce in your mind that it’s bedtime. Budget 30 Minutes for Winding Down: Take advantage of whatever puts you in a state of calm such as soft music, light stretching, reading, and/or relaxation exercises. Dim Your Lights: Try to keep away from bright lights because they can hinder the production of melatonin, a hormone that the body creates to facilitate sleep. Unplug from Electronics: Build in a 30-60-minute pre-bed buffer time that is device-free. Cell phones, tablets, and laptops cause mental stimulation that is hard to shut off and also generate blue light that may decrease melatonin production. Test Methods of Relaxation: Instead of making falling asleep your goal, it’s often easier to focus on relaxation. Meditation, mindfulness, paced breathing, and other relaxation techniques can put you in the right mindset for bed. Don’t Toss and Turn: It helps to have a healthy mental connection between being in bed and actually being asleep. For that reason, if after 20 minutes you haven’t gotten to sleep, get up and stretch, read, or do something else calming in low light before trying to fall asleep again. It’s not just bedtime habits that play a part in getting good sleep. Incorporating positive routines during the day can support your circadian rhythm and limit sleep disruptions. Number 3. Positive daytime routines Get Daylight Exposure: Light, especially sunlight, is one of the key drivers of circadian rhythms that can encourage quality sleep. Be Physically Active: Regular exercise can make it easier to sleep at night and also delivers a host of other health benefits. Don’t Smoke: Nicotine stimulates the body in ways that disrupt sleep, which helps explain why smoking is correlated with numerous sleeping problems. Check out our video on how smoking affects your body – by clicking the banner above. Reduce Alcohol Consumption: Alcohol may make it easier to fall asleep, but the effect wears off, disrupting sleep later in the night. As a result, it’s best to moderate alcohol consumption and avoid it later in the evening. Cut Down on Caffeine in the Afternoon and Evening: Because it’s a stimulant, caffeine can keep you active even when you want to rest, so try to avoid it later in the day. Also, be aware if you’re consuming lots of caffeine to try to make up for lack of sleep. Don’t Dine Late: Eating dinner late, especially if it’s a big, heavy, or spicy meal, can mean you’re still digesting when it’s time for bed. In general, any food or snacks before bed should be on the lighter side. Number 4. Optimize Your Bedroom A central component of sleep hygiene beyond just habits is your sleep environment. To fall asleep more easily, you want your bedroom to be a supportive and comfortable environment. While what makes a bedroom comfortable can vary from one person to the next, but these tips may help make it calm and free of disruptions: Have a Comfortable Mattress and Pillow: Your sleeping surface is critical to comfort and pain-free sleep, so choose your mattress and pillow wisely. Use Excellent Bedding: The sheets and blankets are the first thing you touch when you get into bed, so it’s beneficial to make sure they match your needs and preferences. Set a Cool Yet Comfortable Temperature: Fine-tune your bedroom temperature to suit your preferences, but prefer it on the cooler side. Block Out Light: Use heavy curtains or an eye mask to prevent light from interrupting your sleep. Drown Out Noise: Ear plugs can stop noise from keeping you awake, and if you don’t find them comfortable, you can try a white noise machine or even a fan to drown out bothersome sounds. Try Calming Scents: Light smells, such as lavender, may induce a calmer state of mind and help cultivate a positive space for sleep. Is Sleep Hygiene the Same for Everyone? The basic concept of sleep hygiene — that your environment and habits can be optimized for better sleep — applies to just about everyone, but what ideal sleep hygiene looks like varies from person to person. For that reason, it’s worth testing out different adjustments to find out what helps your sleep the most. You don’t have to change everything at once; small steps can move you toward better sleep hygiene. It’s also important to know that improving sleep hygiene won’t always resolve sleeping problems. People who have serious insomnia or sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea may benefit from better sleep hygiene, but other treatments are usually necessary as well. If you have long-lasting or severe sleeping problems or daytime sleepiness, it’s best to talk with a doctor who can recommend the most appropriate course of treatment.

Making changes to your diet and lifestyle may help improve your sleep quality. Certain supplements and natural remedies could also be beneficial.

A good night’s sleep is just as important for your health as regular exercise and a healthy diet.

Researchshows that poor sleep can have a negative effect on your thinking ability, mood, heart health, immune health, and more. It can also increase your chances of developing obesity and diabetes, among other health conditions.

For this reason, getting a good night’s sleep is one of the most important things you can do to optimize your health.

Here are 15 evidence-based tips to help you sleep better at night.

Spending time in natural sunlight or bright light during the daycan helpkeep yourcircadian rhythmhealthy and, in turn, improve your daytimeenergyand nighttime sleep quality and duration.

The results of asmall 2022 studysuggest thatdaytime bright light exposurecan improve sleep quality and duration. For this reason, it’s a good idea to get daily sunlight exposure or, if that’s not possible for you, to invest in an artificial bright light device or bulbs.

An earlier2017 studyof more than 100 office workers found that those who were exposed to a lot of light in the morning had less time to fall asleep at night, especially in winter. They also found better synchronization of the body’s internal clock and an improved quality of sleep.

Nighttime light exposure can have the opposite effect from daytime exposure because it reduces your levels of some hormones —including melatonin, which helps you relax and get deep sleep.

Blue light, which electronic devices like smartphones and computers give off in large amounts, is the worst type in this regard.

There are several popular methods you can use to reduce nighttimeblue light exposure. These include wearingglasses that block blue lightand turning off the TV, other devices, and any bright lights 2 hours before bed.

A single dose ofcaffeinecan enhance focus, energy, and sports performance. However, the authors of a2023 research reviewfound that late caffeine consumption reduced total sleep time by 45 minutes and overall sleep efficiency by 7%.

This may be because caffeine may have anegative effectonREM sleep, though the research on daytime caffeine consumption and sleepisn’t conclusive.

To be safe, it’s a good idea to avoid drinking caffeinated beverages at least8 hoursbefore bedtime. And if you’re taking a caffeine supplement, don’t take it within 13 hours of bedtime.

If you find yourself craving a cup of coffee in the late afternoon or evening, stick withdecaffeinatedcoffee.

While short power naps can be beneficial, taking long or irregular naps during the day can negatively affect your nighttime sleep.

Sleeping in the daytime can confuse your internal clock, meaning that youmay have a hard timefalling asleep at night.

But the effects of napping vary from person to person. For example, a2021 reviewsuggests that napping might be helpful for people who are athletes or engage in strenuous physical activity and might not compromise their nighttime sleep quality.

If you take regular daytime naps and sleep well, you shouldn’t worry. But if they seem to be disrupting your nighttime sleep, consider cutting them shorter or limiting them.

Your body’s circadian rhythm functions on a set loop, aligning itself with sunrise and sunset. That’s why being consistent with your sleep and waking times can aid long-term sleep quality.

A2020 reviewof 41 studies found that going to bed late or having an irregular sleep pattern negatively affected sleep quality.

If you have trouble sleeping, try to get into the habit of waking up and going to bed at similar times every day. After several weeks, you might not even need an alarm.

Melatoninis a key sleep hormone that tells your brain when it’s time to relax and head to bed. Melatonin supplements are an extremelypopular sleep aidandmay help youfall asleep faster.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t classify melatonin as a drug, which means that, as with other supplements, the FDA does not regulate its quality or dosage. However, research studies have looked at doses of 0.1 to 10 milligrams (mg) up to 2 hours before bedtime.

You can start with a low dose and work your way up. But before trying melatonin supplements, it’s a good idea to check with a healthcare professional. Always talk with a healthcare professional if you’re thinking about using melatonin as a sleep aid foryour child. Long-term use of this supplement in childrenhas not been well studied.

Several supplements may help you relax and go to sleep,including:

While these supplements are not a magic bullet for sleep issues, they can be useful when combined with other strategies. Make sure to try these supplements one at a time to test their effects on your sleep and to make sure you don’t have a negative reaction.

Having a couple of drinks at night can negatively affect your sleep and hormone levels.

This is becausealcoholis known tocause or increasethe symptoms of sleep apnea, snoring, and disrupted sleep patterns. It also changes nighttime melatonin production, which plays a key role in your body’s circadian rhythm.

While an occasional drink at dinner or when you’re out in the evening isn’t likely to be harmful, consider avoiding drinking alcohol too close to bedtime on most nights.

Learn more:How much alcohol is too much?

Bed quality can also affect sleep. For example, poor-quality bedding can lead to increasedlower back pain, which can make it harder to sleep well.

According to a2021 research review, medium-firm mattresses may be a good choice for comfort and to avoid back pain. However, thebest mattressand bedding for you are extremely subjective. If you’re upgrading your bedding, base your choice on personal preference.

In a2024 review, researchers examined nine studies on sleep quality involving various bedding and sleepwear materials, including cotton, polyester, wool, duck down, goose down, polyester, linen, and a blend of cotton and polyester.

Different materials were found to improve sleep in varying conditions. For example, wool appeared to help adults fall asleep in cool temperatures, while linen appeared to improve sleep quality for young adults in warm temperatures. Goose down was also found to increase slow-wave sleep for young adults in cooler environments.

So, if you haven’t replaced your mattress or bedding for several years, doing so can be a quick — but possibly expensive — fix.

Your bedroom environment isn’t just about how comfortable your bed or bedding is. It’s also important to considertemperature,noiselevel,ventilation, and even the level of allergens orcarbon dioxidein the air.

To optimize your bedroom environment, try to minimize external noise, light, and artificial lights from devices such as alarm clocks.

Also, if possible, keep your bedroom at acomfortable temperature. Around 65°F (18.3°C) seems to be a comfortable temperature for most people, although it depends on your preferences and habits. It might also be a good idea to work onimproving your home’s air quality.

Eating late at night maynegatively affectsleep quality. Consider eating dinner at least a few hours before you go to bed. If you do choose to eat later, limit consumption to a small snack.

The quality and type of food in yourlate night snackmight also play a role in your sleep. For example, high carb foodhas been foundto have a worse effect on sleep than low carb food.

“Nocturia” is the medical term for excessive urination during the night. Itcan negatively affectboth sleep quality and daytime energy.

Drinking large amounts of liquids before bed can lead to similar symptoms, though some people are more sensitive than others.

Although hydration isvital for your health, it’s wise to reduce your fluid intake late in the evening.

As with food, try not to drink any fluids for 1–2 hours before going to bed.

You should also use the bathroom right before going to bed, as this may decrease your chances of waking up at night.

Learn more:Drinking water before bed.

Practicing relaxation techniques before bed has been shown to improve sleep quality. These techniques are also a common method used to treat insomnia. Examples includemindfulness, meditation, and evenlistening to music.

You could also try reading a book, taking a hot bath,deep breathing, orvisualization. Try out different methods to find what works best for you.

An underlying health condition may be the cause of your sleep problems.

One common issue issleep apnea. A 2023 review suggests that about33.9% of men and 17.4% of womenin the United States have sleep apnea.

Other sleep disorders include:

You might also experienceinsomnia, which can be caused by factors such as stress and underlying medical conditions. According to a 2020 research review, at least10%of adults have chronic insomnia, and 20% experience it occasionally.

If you’ve always had trouble sleeping, it might be a good idea to consult a healthcare professional.

Getting regular physical exercisecan helpimprove sleep and health.

It can enhance all aspects of sleep andhas been usedto reduce symptoms of insomnia.

Although daily exercise is key for a good night’s sleep, exercising too late in the daymay causesleep problems.

This is due to the stimulatory effect of exercise, which increases alertness and levels of hormones such as epinephrine and adrenaline. However, this can also depend on the individual.

The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend getting150 minutesof exercise per week. If you spread this throughout the week and make sure to leave a few hours between your workout and bedtime, you may notice a positive effect on your sleep quality.

This is onestrategy for better sleep. Starting 10 hours before bedtime, avoid consuming caffeine. Three hours before bed, limit alcohol and food. Two hours before bed, try to relax and avoid mentally taxing tasks. One hour before bed put away all your electronics.

There are many strategies you can try to help yourself learn to sleep better. For starters, it can be helpful to establish a sleep routine. Then, you can work on making your environment more conducive to sleep, reducing light and noise close to bedtime, and limiting the foods and drinks you consume before you go to bed.

You're not doomed to toss and turn every night. Consider simple tips for better sleep, from setting a sleep schedule to including physical activity in your daily routine.

Many factors can interfere with a good night's sleep — from work stress and family responsibilities to illnesses. It's no wonder that quality sleep is sometimes elusive.

You might not be able to control the factors that interfere with your sleep. However, you can adopt habits that encourage better sleep. Start with these simple tips.

Set aside no more than eight hours for sleep. The recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult is at least seven hours. Most people don't need more than eight hours in bed to be well rested.

Go to bed and get up at the same time every day, including weekends. Being consistent reinforces your body's sleep-wake cycle.

If you don't fall asleep within about 20 minutes of going to bed, leave your bedroom and do something relaxing. Read or listen to soothing music. Go back to bed when you're tired. Repeat as needed, but continue to maintain your sleep schedule and wake-up time.

Don't go to bed hungry or stuffed. In particular, avoid heavy or large meals within a couple of hours of bedtime. Discomfort might keep you up.

Nicotine, caffeine and alcohol deserve caution, too. The stimulating effects of nicotine and caffeine take hours to wear off and can interfere with sleep. And even though alcohol might make you feel sleepy at first, it can disrupt sleep later in the night.

Keep your room cool, dark and quiet. Exposure to light in the evenings might make it more challenging to fall asleep. Avoid prolonged use of light-emitting screens just before bedtime. Consider using room-darkening shades, earplugs, a fan or other devices to create an environment that suits your needs.

Doing calming activities before bedtime, such as taking a bath or using relaxation techniques, might promote better sleep.

Long daytime naps can interfere with nighttime sleep. Limit naps to no more than one hour and avoid napping late in the day.

However, if you work nights, you might need to nap late in the day before work to help make up your sleep debt.

Regular physical activity can promote better sleep. However, avoid being active too close to bedtime.

Spending time outside every day might be helpful, too.

Try to resolve your worries or concerns before bedtime. Jot down what's on your mind and then set it aside for tomorrow.

Stress management might help. Start with the basics, such as getting organized, setting priorities and delegating tasks. Meditation also can ease anxiety.

Nearly everyone has an occasional sleepless night. However, if you often have trouble sleeping, contact your health care provider. Identifying and treating any underlying causes can help you get the better sleep you deserve.

Virend Somers, M.D., Ph.D.:When you don't sleep well, bad things happen.

Vivien Williams:Dr. Virend Somers is a cardiologist who studies sleep.

Dr. Somers:Sleep is very much a multidisciplinary specialty for good reason because sleep affects all the organs of the body.

Vivien Williams:Poor sleep may increase your risk of conditions such as heart disease, obesity, depression, dementia. And it even affects how you look. Dr. Somers offers the following tips: Avoid alcohol and big meals before bed; don't exercise right before bed; and turn off all screens, including your smartphone, an hour before bed.

Dr. Somers:We've got bright lights all over the place, and then we switch the lights off, we lie in bed and expect to sleep. The bedroom, the bed is for sex and sleep. It's not for spreadsheets, it's not for watching TV.

Vivien Williams:He also suggests keeping your bedroom as dark and quiet as possible. Healthy sleep for a healthy life. For the Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Vivien Williams.

An earlier2017 studyof more than 100 office workers found that those who were exposed to a lot of light in the morning had less time to fall asleep at night, especially in winter. They also found better synchronization of the body’s internal clock and an improved quality of sleep.

Nighttime light exposure can have the opposite effect from daytime exposure because it reduces your levels of some hormones —including melatonin, which helps you relax and get deep sleep.

Blue light, which electronic devices like smartphones and computers give off in large amounts, is the worst type in this regard.

There are several popular methods you can use to reduce nighttimeblue light exposure. These include wearingglasses that block blue lightand turning off the TV, other devices, and any bright lights 2 hours before bed.

A single dose ofcaffeinecan enhance focus, energy, and sports performance. However, the authors of a2023 research reviewfound that late caffeine consumption reduced total sleep time by 45 minutes and overall sleep efficiency by 7%.

This may be because caffeine may have anegative effectonREM sleep, though the research on daytime caffeine consumption and sleepisn’t conclusive.

To be safe, it’s a good idea to avoid drinking caffeinated beverages at least8 hoursbefore bedtime. And if you’re taking a caffeine supplement, don’t take it within 13 hours of bedtime.

If you find yourself craving a cup of coffee in the late afternoon or evening, stick withdecaffeinatedcoffee.

While short power naps can be beneficial, taking long or irregular naps during the day can negatively affect your nighttime sleep.

Sleeping in the daytime can confuse your internal clock, meaning that youmay have a hard timefalling asleep at night.

But the effects of napping vary from person to person. For example, a2021 reviewsuggests that napping might be helpful for people who are athletes or engage in strenuous physical activity and might not compromise their nighttime sleep quality.

If you take regular daytime naps and sleep well, you shouldn’t worry. But if they seem to be disrupting your nighttime sleep, consider cutting them shorter or limiting them.

Your body’s circadian rhythm functions on a set loop, aligning itself with sunrise and sunset. That’s why being consistent with your sleep and waking times can aid long-term sleep quality.

A2020 reviewof 41 studies found that going to bed late or having an irregular sleep pattern negatively affected sleep quality.

If you have trouble sleeping, try to get into the habit of waking up and going to bed at similar times every day. After several weeks, you might not even need an alarm.

Melatoninis a key sleep hormone that tells your brain when it’s time to relax and head to bed. Melatonin supplements are an extremelypopular sleep aidandmay help youfall asleep faster.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t classify melatonin as a drug, which means that, as with other supplements, the FDA does not regulate its quality or dosage. However, research studies have looked at doses of 0.1 to 10 milligrams (mg) up to 2 hours before bedtime.

You can start with a low dose and work your way up. But before trying melatonin supplements, it’s a good idea to check with a healthcare professional. Always talk with a healthcare professional if you’re thinking about using melatonin as a sleep aid foryour child. Long-term use of this supplement in childrenhas not been well studied.

Several supplements may help you relax and go to sleep,including:

While these supplements are not a magic bullet for sleep issues, they can be useful when combined with other strategies. Make sure to try these supplements one at a time to test their effects on your sleep and to make sure you don’t have a negative reaction.

Having a couple of drinks at night can negatively affect your sleep and hormone levels.

This is becausealcoholis known tocause or increasethe symptoms of sleep apnea, snoring, and disrupted sleep patterns. It also changes nighttime melatonin production, which plays a key role in your body’s circadian rhythm.

While an occasional drink at dinner or when you’re out in the evening isn’t likely to be harmful, consider avoiding drinking alcohol too close to bedtime on most nights.

Bed quality can also affect sleep. For example, poor-quality bedding can lead to increasedlower back pain, which can make it harder to sleep well.

According to a2021 research review, medium-firm mattresses may be a good choice for comfort and to avoid back pain. However, thebest mattressand bedding for you are extremely subjective. If you’re upgrading your bedding, base your choice on personal preference.

In a2024 review, researchers examined nine studies on sleep quality involving various bedding and sleepwear materials, including cotton, polyester, wool, duck down, goose down, polyester, linen, and a blend of cotton and polyester.

Different materials were found to improve sleep in varying conditions. For example, wool appeared to help adults fall asleep in cool temperatures, while linen appeared to improve sleep quality for young adults in warm temperatures. Goose down was also found to increase slow-wave sleep for young adults in cooler environments.

So, if you haven’t replaced your mattress or bedding for several years, doing so can be a quick — but possibly expensive — fix.

Your bedroom environment isn’t just about how comfortable your bed or bedding is. It’s also important to considertemperature,noiselevel,ventilation, and even the level of allergens orcarbon dioxidein the air.

To optimize your bedroom environment, try to minimize external noise, light, and artificial lights from devices such as alarm clocks.

Also, if possible, keep your bedroom at acomfortable temperature. Around 65°F (18.3°C) seems to be a comfortable temperature for most people, although it depends on your preferences and habits. It might also be a good idea to work onimproving your home’s air quality.

Eating late at night maynegatively affectsleep quality. Consider eating dinner at least a few hours before you go to bed. If you do choose to eat later, limit consumption to a small snack.

The quality and type of food in yourlate night snackmight also play a role in your sleep. For example, high carb foodhas been foundto have a worse effect on sleep than low carb food.

“Nocturia” is the medical term for excessive urination during the night. Itcan negatively affectboth sleep quality and daytime energy.

Drinking large amounts of liquids before bed can lead to similar symptoms, though some people are more sensitive than others.

Although hydration isvital for your health, it’s wise to reduce your fluid intake late in the evening.

As with food, try not to drink any fluids for 1–2 hours before going to bed.

You should also use the bathroom right before going to bed, as this may decrease your chances of waking up at night.

Learn more:Drinking water before bed.

Practicing relaxation techniques before bed has been shown to improve sleep quality. These techniques are also a common method used to treat insomnia. Examples includemindfulness, meditation, and evenlistening to music.

You could also try reading a book, taking a hot bath,deep breathing, orvisualization. Try out different methods to find what works best for you.

An underlying health condition may be the cause of your sleep problems.

One common issue issleep apnea. A 2023 review suggests that about33.9% of men and 17.4% of womenin the United States have sleep apnea.

Other sleep disorders include:

You might also experienceinsomnia, which can be caused by factors such as stress and underlying medical conditions. According to a 2020 research review, at least10%of adults have chronic insomnia, and 20% experience it occasionally.

If you’ve always had trouble sleeping, it might be a good idea to consult a healthcare professional.

Getting regular physical exercisecan helpimprove sleep and health.

It can enhance all aspects of sleep andhas been usedto reduce symptoms of insomnia.

Although daily exercise is key for a good night’s sleep, exercising too late in the daymay causesleep problems.

This is due to the stimulatory effect of exercise, which increases alertness and levels of hormones such as epinephrine and adrenaline. However, this can also depend on the individual.

The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend getting150 minutesof exercise per week. If you spread this throughout the week and make sure to leave a few hours between your workout and bedtime, you may notice a positive effect on your sleep quality.

This is onestrategy for better sleep. Starting 10 hours before bedtime, avoid consuming caffeine. Three hours before bed, limit alcohol and food. Two hours before bed, try to relax and avoid mentally taxing tasks. One hour before bed put away all your electronics.

There are many strategies you can try to help yourself learn to sleep better. For starters, it can be helpful to establish a sleep routine. Then, you can work on making your environment more conducive to sleep, reducing light and noise close to bedtime, and limiting the foods and drinks you consume before you go to bed.

(00:00) do you feel tired all the time maybe you feel like you can't exist without coffee and even that is not enough you have no energy during the day and you have no idea why and it's not just you you probably hear the people around you talking about their lack of energy too their chronic feelings of fatigue so many of us feel like this just tired all the time according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention fatigue is one of the most common reasons people visit their health care provider in fact
(00:30) it's estimated that up to one-third of adults report feeling fatigued or excessively tired now there are a lot of potential reasons why someone might be feeling tired all the time but there is one reason that not a lot of people know about and it's possible that this reason is at the root of your constant lack of energy your gut so in this video I'm going to be explaining the connection between our gut and our energy and teach you why your gut might be causing this constant feeling of fatigue and that's
(00:59) even if you don't don't have any digestive symptoms at all you might be feeling like well I don't have any gut issues but it's possible that you still have trouble that you just don't realize now if you've watched me here on YouTube before then welcome back but if you are new to my channel then welcome I'm Dr Kim Foster and I'm an MD turned coach and wellness expert and I was a family doctor for 20 years before leaving the Health Care system to focus entirely on my Wellness business and I'm also the
(01:28) founder of the wellness coach Academy where I train the next generation of Wellness coaches and here on YouTube I talk about wellness and business and share all kinds of tips to help you master The Art of Living Well and if those are things that you're interested in then go ahead and subscribe because I upload new videos every week now let's talk about the connection between your gut and your energy when it comes to feeling tired there are a lot of potential causes and everybody is different so first off it's important to
(01:59) talk to your Healthcare care provider to assess for some of the common causes of fatigue like anemia or hypothyroidism or diabetes but I know that many of you have already done that you've talked to your doctor you've had some blood work done and you have been told that everything is fine so is it possible that there's something happening in your gut that is the underlying cause of your fatigue yes basically this is something that we're only just starting to understand but we are learning now that
(02:29) the health of our gut is intricately connected with that of our overall health there's a well-known connection between our gut and our brains and we know now that our gut can affect our moods and our thinking through the gut brain axis but what about our energy levels well research shows that the gut can impact our energy in surprising ways so to understand how this works you really need to understand what the gut microbiome is if you haven't heard of the gut microbiome before it's a complex ecosystem of my microorganisms that live
(03:02) in our gastrointestinal tract consists of trillions of microorganisms including bacteria fungi viruses and other microbes and together they all play a crucial role in maintaining our overall health and well-being so the gut microbiome performs a wide range of important functions such as helping to digest food and producing essential vitamins nutrients regulating the immune system and protecting against harmful infections what we have found is that overall people who experience a lot of fatigue tend to exhibit less diversity
(03:33) in their microbiome basically fewer species of microorganism we know that the more diversity that someone has in their microbiome the better so what's going on here why does this matter well for one thing this has to do with absorbing the nutrients in our food the microbes that are living in your gut help your digestive tract to process all that food that you're eating and one key part of this process is absorbing the nutrients in the variety of foods that you eat the truth is your gut microbiome does a better job at nutrient absorption
(04:04) when it is well balanced if you have too few of the beneficial strains of bacteria or too many of the harmful ones then your digestive tract may not be able to completely absorb all of the vitamins and minerals found in the foods that you eat and when you have poor nutrient absorption that can have a whole bunch of negative effects everything from lowering your immune system to causing your muscles to feel kind of achy and yes having lowered energy so feeling sluggish all the time can be a sign that your body isn't
(04:33) getting the nutrients that it needs and if your diet is kind of balanced then there's a good chance that your gut is to blame there's also the effect of inflammation so when you have an imbalance of good and bad bacteria in your gut the bad guys can generate byproducts that trigger the lining of your intestines and your immune system to release inflammatory molecules which creates an environment of low-grade inflammation in the gut it's kind of like how you feel really exhausted after getting hit by a cold gold or the flu
(05:01) it's not the virus itself that's causing you to feel that it's your body's own immune response it's telling you to shut down non-essential functions so it can have extra energy and resources for going to war with the infection when you have the flu you kind of crawl under the covers and just watch Netflix for a few days and of course then it passes but when you have chronic low-grade inflammation in your gut happening all the time that creates that vague feeling of being tired that's kind of lurking in
(05:30) the background and it can last for months or even years so now that we're starting to get a sense of what the problem is the next question is what do we do about it so basically it all comes down to improving your gut microbiome which will improve your gut health as a whole and what are some ways to improve and support a healthy gut microbiome well I have eight things that you can do the first is to eat whole unprocessed Foods when you eat a diet rich in Whole Foods mostly plants that can help to nourish the beneficial bacteria in your
(06:01) gut you also want to eat a diverse range of foods because there are hundreds of species of bacteria in your intestines Each of which plays a specific role in your health and requires different nutrients for growth and as we talked about a diverse microbiome is a healthy one so if you want more Guidance with what foods to eat and which ones to avoid for gut health I've put together a food checklist and you can download that checklist for free by just clicking the link below in the description box okay the next tip is to consume fermented
(06:31) foods so here we're talking about food like yogurt kefir kimchi sauerkraut and kombucha these foods contain live bacteria that can help support a healthy gut microbiome when Foods undergo fermentation the sugars they contain are naturally broken down by microorganisms before you even eat them and this is a good thing however be aware that many yogurts especially flavored yogurts contain a very high amount of sugar your best bet is to opt for plain unsweetened yogurt or flavored yogurt with minimal added sugar also make sure that the
(07:05) label says contains live active cultures so your next strategy is to eat Prebiotic Foods so prebiotics are types of fiber that nourish the beneficial bacteria in your gut basically you want to be thinking about what you are feeding the friendly bacteria that are living in your gut right now because they are counting on you to send the right Foods down to them so that they can Thrive and flourish so prebiotics are mostly fiber or complex carbs that human cells can't digest instead certain species of bacteria in the gut break
(07:38) them down and use them for fuel foods like garlic onions bananas and asparagus these are good sources of prebiotics beans and legumes also contain very high amounts of fiber and are great for this purpose too and so are berries and artichokes and apples okay next up let's talk about probiotics in addition to the dietary changes that you can make to improve your gut health you might also choose to take a probiotic supplement now probiotics contain live bacteria that can help replenish the beneficial bacteria in your gut and this one
(08:11) probably needs to be the subject of a future video since I know that there are a lot of products on the market now and it can be confusing and hard to know which probiotic can be best for you so stay tuned for that for now let's move on to tip number five which is to avoid overusing antibiotics so all I'm going to say about this is that we know that overusing antibiotics can disrupt the balance of bacteria in your gut so it's important to only take antibiotics when necessary and sometimes it is necessary
(08:40) so this isn't an invitation to disregard the guidance from your healthcare provider but we also know that as a culture we way overuse antibiotics so it's really something to be mindful of all right moving on to tip number six which is to manage your stress this is definitely the subject of some future videos in fact I've created videos about this topic before because it is such a big issue but we know now that chronic stress can negatively affect the gut microbiome so practicing stress reducing activities can be very helpful for
(09:12) improving our gut health you can try things like meditation yoga or even just doing some simple deep breathing exercises on a regular basis okay the next strategy is to exercise regularly so why does this matter it doesn't really seem connected right well studies are now showing that regular exercise can help support a healthy gut microbiome by increasing the diversity of bacteria in your gut and promoting a more favorable balance of beneficial bacteria which is just another reason to get moving on a regular basis right if
(09:44) this is something that you need more help with then I'll link a couple of videos about this topic so that you can check those out next now that brings us to my final tip for improving your gut health so that you can boost your energy and that is to get enough sleep now this is another piece of General Wellness advice that it turns out is connected to our gut studies are showing that adequate sleep is important for maintaining a healthy gut microbiome in fact disruptions in our sleep patterns can negatively affect the balance of
(10:14) bacteria in our gut so it's not just that you're feeling tired because you didn't get enough sleep last night it's that you are not getting enough sleep on a regular basis and that's messing with your gut microbiome which can cause fatigue in a whole bunch of additional ways okay that's the end of my eight tips but I do actually have a bonus tip tip number nine and that is to not accept the feeling of fatigue that you have had all this time it can start to feel normal because everyone around us
(10:41) is complaining of the same thing so it's not your fault if you think oh well I guess I'm just getting older and this seems kind of common so I guess it's normal but it's not normal feeling tired all the time can dramatically reduce your ability to enjoy life and participate in your life the way that you want to and no one should have to settle for feeling that way I hope that I have given you some new food for thought when it comes to what might be going on inside you that is causing you to feel so tired all the time and what
(11:10) you can start to do about it and again if you want that checklist to help you eat more food to support your gut health and as a result your energy be sure to grab it for free by following the link in the description box now if you enjoyed this video then go ahead and let me know in the comments below and was this something that you have thought of before have you heard about this connection between gut health and fatigue I would love to know let me know in the comments below this video I would be really interested to hear your
(11:40) thoughts okay that's a wrap for this video take care have a wonderful day and I will see you again very soon [Music] foreign [Music]

Transcript:
(00:01) (gentle happy music) (chime) - [Narrator] Do you feel tired all the time, but don't know why? Does doing even the simplest and quickest of tasks make you feel exhausted and weary? We've made a video on seven signs of emotional burnout to find out more. Chronic fatigue can be caused by a number of different factors.
(00:22) Usually things like a poor diet, dehydration, lack of exercise, and a bad sleeping habit are to blame. But what if it isn't your physical health but rather your mental health that's the problem? If you're eating healthy, getting lots of sleep, and exercising regularly but still struggled to make it through most days, then the tiredness you feel is most likely due to emotional and mental distress.
(00:44) With that said, here are six possible psychological reasons why you feel tired all the time. One, you're overwhelmed with life. Are you going through a particularly difficult time in your life right now, like dealing with the death of a loved one, the end of an important relationship, or adjusting to an unfamiliar environment? It can be overwhelming enough that you start to feel exhausted all the time trying to deal with it.
(01:08) There's too much pressure weighing you down, too many decisions to make, too many duties and responsibilities you need to attend to. You feel like you don't have room to breathe anymore. And you're seriously starting to think that you're only inches away from a complete mental breakdown. Two, you're in a toxic environment.
(01:27) Does your family barely ever get along with each other? Are your parents always screaming at one another? Or perhaps you feel like they're all just taking advantage of you without any care for your personal wellbeing at all. Maybe it's your work life that's got you feeling so burnt out all the time.
(01:42) Is your boss overworking you to the point where you have no work-life balance anymore? Or maybe all your work mates are trying to sabotage one another. Either way, being in a toxic environment constantly puts your mental health at risk and drains a lot of your energy. Three, you've neglected your self care.
(01:59) Have you been neglecting to take care of yourself? You stop eating right, you barely get any sleep, and you don't keep yourself hydrated or physically fit. Not only that, but you don't make time for yourself to do the things you love and enjoy. You don't have a social life anymore, you don't spend time with your friends and family.
(02:16) And worst of all, you've lost touch with yourself. Four, you feel anxious all the time. It's not uncommon for people who suffer from anxiety disorders to feel exhausted all the time, because your brain is always on high alert, fight or flight mode. You often experienced sudden spikes in energy levels, which leads you to feeling mentally and emotionally drained.
(02:37) You feel tired a lot because your mind is usually running a hundred miles a minute, overthinking and fixating on all the ways something could go horribly wrong. Five, you're suffering from depression. Chronic fatigue is one of the core criteria for a person to be diagnosed with depression, along with feelings of sadness, emptiness, loneliness, and hopelessness.
(02:58) When you're depressed, you don't have the energy or motivation to do anything, not even the things you used to love and enjoy so much. You feel exhausted even when you're just lying in bed all day. You wonder what the point is in doing anything at all anymore. You become emotionally numb, shallow, and apathetic.
(03:15) It's a kind of tiredness that doesn't go away, no matter how much rest, eat, or sleep you get. And six, you're always stressed out. Are you stressing about studying for a good grade, meaning an important deadline, or finishing a project perfectly? Constant long-term exposure to high levels of stress is one of the leading causes behind emotional and mental exhaustion.
(03:39) When you're stressed out, your body kicks into high gear and expends all of its energy on dealing with whatever it is you're so stressed out about. Researchers have found that an oversupply of cortisol and adrenaline can wear you out over time. and even cause you to suffer a mental or emotional crash.
(03:55) Sometimes treating exhaustion with some rest and relaxation, eating healthy, getting lots of sleep, and exercising regularly isn't gonna be enough. It's important that you get to the root of the problem, so you know the best way to treat it. Do you relate to any of these reasons mentioned here? what do you plan to do next? If you're worried about your mental health, reach out to a therapist or a counselor today and get the help you need to deal with your problems in a positive way.
(04:20) And who knows? It might just bring back the skip in your step again.

If you’re worn down and sluggish, it can be more than just feeling exhausted

Feeling run down after what you thought was a good night’s sleep? Reaching for that third cup of coffee by noon to keep you going? Sure, we all feel tired at different points in our lives.

But if you’re always feeling tired, it can be more than just not getting enough sleep. Feeling tired can stem from more serious issues like sleep apnea, depression, diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

Family medicine specialist Jared Ankerman, MD, discusses the different reasons you might be feeling so tired.

Are being tired and feeling fatigued the same thing? Yes and no, says Dr. Ankerman.

“In today’s day and age, we use those terms interchangeably, which isn’t correct,” he says. “Tiredness is something that is natural. You might be tired after a busy day at work or exercising. That’s normal and most people experience that.”

On the other hand, fatigue is more intense than just being tired.

“No matter how much you rest, or how little you do, you still have this feeling of not having a ton of energy or ability to do much,” says Dr. Ankerman. “It can sometimes be a sign of something more serious going on.”

So what might be causing you to be tired or feelfatigued? Here are a few reasons.

If you have an iron deficiency,known as anemia, you don’t produce enough red blood cells. Those cells are needed to supply your body with the right amount of oxygen for organs to function correctly. It can lead you to feel run down and exhausted.

Anemia is the most common blood condition in the U.S., affecting an estimated 3 million Americans.

Are you waking up throughout the night? You may havesleep apnea, a sleep disorder where your breathing is interrupted during sleep.

While sleep apnea can lead to other health problems like high blood pressure, diabetes and heart attacks, it can also cause you to feel more tired than usual.

“Inadequate sleep or broken irregular sleep can contribute to fatigue or tiredness,” says Dr. Ankerman. “A lot of people are chronically sleep deficient. I recommend that adults try to get at least eight hours of sleep.”

It makes sense that if you’re pregnant you might be more tired than usual.

“It’s a strain on your body,” says Dr. Ankerman. “You’re growing another human inside your body. Your body’s working to support you and the fetus with blood flow and energy.”

Especially in your first trimester, you produce moreprogesterone, a hormone that can cause you to feel tired.

For people who have diabetes, feeling tired is one of the main symptoms.

“If people are poorly controlling theirdiabetes, they will see a spike in their blood sugar levels,” says Dr. Ankerman. “Having those spikes can actually dehydrate you slightly and that can cause fatigue.”

Talking to your doctor about how you’re tired is a good starting point on determining if there are any underlying causes, says Dr. Ankerman. Your doctor will start with your medical history, do a physical exam and possibly request bloodwork.

“If that’s all normal and we can’t find any cause of fatigue or tiredness, we’ll start to look atmood disorders,” says Dr. Ankerman.

Depression can cause you to have little interest in daily activities, which can lead to fatigue, as well as affect your eating and sleeping habits.

Hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland (a small, butterfly-shaped organ located near the front of your neck) doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormone. Your metabolism starts to slow down and that can lead to fatigue.

“When you talk to your doctor they will likely order some tests on your thyroid to determine if you have thyroid issues,” says Dr. Ankerman.

A decrease in kidney function may lead to a collection of toxins and impurities in the blood, which can cause you to feel tired and weak. Another risk factor? You can develop anemia, which can also explain your tiredness.

“Especially patients who have end-stage renal disease or those who are on dialysis, they can have issues with fatigue,” says Dr. Ankerman.

You havea coldorthe flu. You’re feeling worn down and tired. That’s because your body is fighting the infection and it’s putting a strain on your immune system.

“More serious bacterial and viral infections can interact with different organ systems which can cause fatigue,” says Dr. Ankerman.

Infections likemononucleosisandCOVID-19can even cause long-lasting tiredness.

Not getting enough vitamin B12 or vitamin D? That can cause you to feel tired as well.

“I normally look for certain nutritional deficiencies,” says Dr. Ankerman. “Having a vitamin deficiency can cause issues with fatigue.”

If your doctor finds you have a vitamin deficiency, they may suggest dietary changes orusing supplements.

If you have persistent, crippling fatigue that lasts 6 months or longer, you may havechronic fatigue syndrome.

“Chronic fatigue syndrome has been studied more in the past five to 10 years,” says Dr. Ankerman. “Before it was thought of to be more of a psychiatric diagnosis.”

Those with chronic fatigue syndrome may experience symptoms like:

“It can be debilitating,” says Dr. Ankerman.

While there is no cure for chronic fatigue syndrome, it can be managed with cognitive behavioral therapy and medication like sleep aids.

“It’s so important to talk to your doctor if you’re having symptoms,” says Dr. Ankerman. “If you’re concerned that this could be something more than just run-of-the-mill tiredness, they can help.”

Not getting enough sleep is one reason why you may be tired. Other possible reasons include nutrient deficiencies, stress, an underlying health condition, and drug side effects. If you have chronic fatigue, see a doctor for a diagnosis.

If you’re feeling overly tired or have little energy, you’re not alone.

Fatigue may be caused by simple factors like a lack of sleep or coming down with a cold or the flu. However, it can also be caused by underlying health conditions.

In most cases, fatigue can be remedied by lifestyle or dietary modifications, correcting a nutrient deficiency, or treating an underlying medical condition. Still, to improve fatigue, you need to get to the bottom of what’s causing it.

Here are 12 potential reasons why you’re always tired.

Getting enough sleep is essential for overall health. Unfortunately, many of us don’t get enough, which may lead to fatigue.

During sleep, your body performs anumber of critical processes, including releasing important growth hormones and repairing and regenerating cells. This is why most people wake up feeling refreshed, alert, and energized after a night ofhigh quality sleep.

Even though sleep time should be individualized adults should get at least7 hours of sleep per nightfor optimal health.

Insomnia is a term for any condition that causes difficulty falling or staying asleep. It can have several causes, including menopause, medical conditions, psychological stress, poor sleeping environments, and excessive mental stimulation.

If you’re experiencing insomnia,treatmentslike natural supplements, medications, and the management of underlying medical conditions may help. Visit your doctor to get the appropriate care and treatment.

Nutrient deficienciesmay lead you to feel exhausted on a daily basis, even if you’re getting more than 7 hours of sleep.

Deficiencies in thefollowing nutrientshave been linked to fatigue:

If you are experiencing fatigue, discuss with your healthcare professional if it is necessary to test for deficiencies. Typically, fatigue related to a deficiency in one or more nutrients improves once your nutrient levels normalize.

Although some stress is normal, chronic stress canlead to fatigue. In fact, chronic stress may lead to stress-related exhaustion disorder (ED), a medical condition characterized by psychological and physical symptoms of exhaustion.

Furthermore, chronic stress may cause structural and functional changes in your brain and lead to chronic inflammation, contributing to symptoms like fatigue.

A therapist may also help you develop strategies to reduce stress. Many health insurance plans cover mental health counseling, and virtual therapy is also an option.

If you’re experiencing unexplained, chronic fatigue, you should visit your doctor and discuss your symptoms.

They may recommend testingto rule outcertain health conditions that cause fatigue, such as:

It’s important to know that it’s abnormal to feel exhausted constantly. If you experience frequent fatigue, there are likely one or more causes.

Getting proper treatment for an underlying medical condition can help you feel better and improve other areas of health as well.

Your diet significantly affects the way you feel.

To maintain energy and get the nutrients your body needs to perform critical processes, it’s important to consume a balanced diet high innutrient-dense foods.

When you don’t obtain enough calories and nutrients like protein, your body breaks down fat and muscle to meet energy demands. This leads to losing body fat and muscle mass, whichmay triggerfatigue.

Additionally, diets high inultra-processed foodsimpair energy levels. For example, a diet high in added sugar may harm sleep and lead to chronically high blood sugar and insulin levels, resulting in fatigue.

Following a diet low in ultra-processed food and added sugar but rich in nutrient-dense foods like fruits, veggies, legumes, andhealthy protein sourcesmay help reduce fatigue and support healthy sleep while providing your body with optimal nutrition.

Although caffeinated beverages like coffee and energy drinks feel like they boost energy, over-reliance on them may make you more tired the next day. That’s because too much caffeine can harm sleep, which may cause fatigue.

Research shows that feeling tired in the morning leads people to consume large amounts of caffeine, which impairs their sleep cycle. In turn, you may overuse coffee or other caffeinated drinks for energy, which continues thecycle of poor sleepfollowed by too much caffeine.

While coffee and caffeinated beverages like green tea may benefit health when consumed in moderation,energy drinksare extremely high in stimulants and added sugar. Thus, you should avoid them whenever possible.

If you’re currently experiencing sleep issues and frequently drink caffeinated beverages, try cutting back to see whether it helps improve your sleep and energy levels.

Staying hydrated is important for maintaining energy levels. The many biochemical reactions that take place in your body every day result in a loss of water that needs to be replaced.

Dehydration occurs when you don’t drink enough liquid to replace the water lost in your urine, stools, sweat, and breath. Being dehydratedleads to lower energy levelsand decreased concentration ability.

Although you may have heard that you should drink eight 8-ounce (240-mL)glasses of water daily, hydration needs depend on several factors, including your weight, age, sex, and activity levels.

The key is drinking enough to maintain good hydration. Commonsymptoms of dehydrationinclude thirst, fatigue,dizziness, andheadaches.

Maintaining ahealthy body weightis essential to overall health.

Not only is obesity significantly linked to a greater risk of many chronic illnesses like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers, but it may also increase your risk of chronic fatigue.

Obesity greatly increases your risk of obstructive sleep apnea, which is a common cause of daytime fatigue. It’s also linked to increased daytime sleepiness regardless of sleep apnea, suggesting that obesity directly affects the sleep cycle.

Maintaining a healthy body weight may support good sleep and energy levels, while getting high quality sleep may help prevent weight gain and reduce fatigue.

Many other conditions may lead to tiredness. It’s important to understand that several factors may contribute to your exhaustion.

Here are a few other common reasons why you may feel tired:

If you need help overcoming your addiction contact theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helplineat 1-800-662-HELP (4357).

Even though everyone has days when they feel exhausted, constantly feeling run down and tired isn’t normal.

Many possible factors cause chronic fatigue, such as underlying medical conditions, nutrient deficiencies, sleep disturbances, caffeine intake, and chronic stress.

If you’re experiencing unexplained fatigue, you must talk with your doctor to find the cause.

In many cases, your fatigue should improve once you identify the underlying cause(s) and make appropriate lifestyle and dietary adjustments — or get the right treatment for medical conditions.

You know your body best and know when something isn’t right. If you’re feeling chronically exhausted even when you get adequate rest, there may be a medical condition contributing to your fatigue.

Work with a doctor you trust to get the right testing to rule out common health conditions that may be contributing to your fatigue.

Breakups of any kind can be arduous and painful. Ideally, moving forward and healing from the emotional wounds that come with the end of a romantic relationship would be straightforward and clear-cut. However, in reality, moving on from an ex is sometimes an agonizing process, andhow long it takes to get over a breakupdepends on the individual and the specific situation. If you feel stuck and unable to untangle yourself from the emotional tie to your ex, here are some of the most likely reasons you can't get over your ex and why it's taking an extraordinarily long time to move on from particular relationships:

It's called euphoric recall, explainsPatrick Wanis, Ph.D., a human behavior expert and author ofGet Over Your Ex Now!and it refers to the recalling of past events or people in a positive light while forgetting or ignoring the negative aspects. "Although it is referred to as 'recall,' it is actually an immediate reliving and re-experiencing of the positive aspects, the pleasure of the past event or person," Wanis tells mbg.

Wanis explains that this same phenomenon occurs in addiction and is directly related to the pleasure or reward centers of the brain.

Euphoric recall is kryptonite to being able to move on, saysApril Davis, owner and founder of LUMA-Luxury Matchmaking. If you only remember the good times you shared together, you'll have a very difficult time moving forward. "It's good to keep in mind that they're an ex for a reason, and it can be good to remember the times that were not so great as well," Davis advises.

A main reason some people struggle to move on from their ex is idealization, counselor Sheryl Paul, M.A., tells mbg. You idealize your ex, convincing yourself they were your "perfect" partner that no one else will match up to. But the reality is that there are many people in the world each person can be compatible with. We really do have manytypes of soul mates, not all of which are meant to be in our lives forever.

According toCherlyn Chong, a transformational coach who specializes in breakup recovery, if you find yourself thinking that your ex was the best you could get and you'll never find someone after them, you've adopted a fixed mindset as opposed to a growth mindset. "This is when you've taken the relationship to mean much more about you than anything else," Chong explains, and your self-esteem is essentially reliant on your ex. In this mindset, "if the relationship fails, it's because you weren't good enough, and therefore, you're not good enough for other relationships either."

Unfortunately, explains Chong, if you continue having this fated mindset, then that's precisely what you are going to get in life. Nothing is stopping you from finding new, perhaps even better love—except your own self-defeating attitude.

If you have unresolved negative beliefs stemming from your past, whether those come from emotionally immature parents or other ex-partners, Chong says you may be stuck in the mindset that youdeserveto suffer and are inadvertently prolonging your own healing process post-breakup.

"Suffering might actually be so familiar to you that you might even be addicted to it, in the same way one becomes addicted to smoking," Chong tells mbg. And sometimes, suffering might be the only thing left from the relationship, and you're afraid that if you let it go, you won't have anything of the relationship left.

In other words, it feels good to feel bad.

"If you still maintain contact with your ex and/or follow them on social media, it can be a constant reminder of what you lost," licensed clinical psychologistRoxy Zarrabi, Psy.D., tells mbg. "Simultaneously, [this could] increase hope [of] one day reconciling."

Ultimately maintaining contact, being in the same social circle, and/or following your ex on social media can exacerbate your distress and prevent you from moving on. Theno-contact ruleis the best way to move on.

When you don't understand why you broke up, your mind will go into overdrive trying to analyze, piece together the events and evidence, and overall continue to ruminate over the breakup. Feeling like you understand what happened is part of getting closure, which is necessary to moving on.

That said, Paul adds that sometimes people can land on an explanation for the breakup and then become obsessed with it: "Because most people have a difficult time tolerating emotional pain, the ego steps in and turns to obsessing aboutwhythe breakup occurred, either blaming everything on your partner or yourself," she explains. "Neither of these negative mind maneuvers are productive toward the ultimate goal of a breakup, which is to grieve the loss to completion and learn whatever you can about yourself."

If youcan'tfigure out the why, that's OK too. Not all breakups "make sense," and it's OK that sometimes people follow their feelings to make decisions rather than using any "logical" reason. Allow yourself to accept that you can't change what happened. Take the lessons you can from it, and then put the analyzing to rest.

According to Zarrabi, if you lost your identity and/or your support system while in your prior relationship, it can be particularly difficult to move on because you may not know who you are anymore without your ex. Focusing on restoring your sense of self during the grieving process and building a new, strong support system that isn't dependent on a romantic partner could help you move past your ex and the successive traumatic feelings that are haunting you post-breakup.

"When people experience a loss, there is a tendency to want to avoid or push those painful feelings away, but, ultimately, doing so will prolong the healing process," Zarrabi tells mbg.

On that note, drowning your feelings only lengthens the amount of time it takes to get over a breakup, says John Kahal, a mental health and addiction expert and founder of Capo by the Sea Rehab in San Juan Capistrano, California. "When dealing with a breakup, one of the most common ways people cope is by drowning their sorrows in alcohol or self-medicating in other ways," he tells mbg. "It can become a comfortable way to numb out and avoid feelings of sadness or loneliness while the pain of a split is fresh."

Instead of trying to push the feelings away, drowning them out with alcohol, or falsely pretending to be fine, both Kahal and Zarrabi emphasize the importance of processing and confronting post-breakup feelings. "Perhaps try a little detox from alcohol, and take some time to let yourself feel and process the emotions the breakup brought on," Kahal suggests. "This can bring about some much-needed closure and allow you to gain some fresh perspective, which is essential to the process of moving on."

Emmy Crouter, LSW, a therapist atEmboldened Counselingin Denver, Colorado, notes that one's own history is a major part of the breakup process.

"If you come from a childhood of abandonment, abuse, or even just feeling misunderstood, especially by one's parents or caretakers, you may be triggered by the loss of a relationship as it brings up old feelings regarding your most important attachment figures," Crouter tells mbg. "Sometimes the breakup [itself] is not what is bothering someone—it's themeaningbehind the breakup and associated early memories that beg to be addressed."

In this case, Crouter suggests therapy as an effective way to explore one's patterns of relating to significant others and how they connect to our earliest relationships and experiences.

Bringing awareness towhyyou might feel stuck in old feelings from a past relationship and unable to move on from your ex is already a considerable first step in moving forward. The next move, then, is to take action and regain autonomy over your own healing process.

In addition to addressing the specific reason you're stuck missing your ex, there areconcrete methodsthat you can begin implementing in your routine such as setting boundaries on social media, beginning a daily meditation practice, or processing through your feelings via journaling. Counseling or therapy can also be really helpful, especially if you feel like being unable to move on from your ex is affecting the rest of your daily living.

All of these solutions can help provide you with the clarity you need to mollify the prolonged anxiety of your breakup and thus allow you tofall in love again after a breakup.

It’s increasingly common for someone to be diagnosed with a condition such as ADHD or autism as an adult. A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers.

Loss of any type, rather it be a divorce, a job termination, the end of afriendshipthat you held dear, or the death of a loved one can send you reeling into unchartered territory. For some, it means the loss of anidentity. You may have found pride in calling yourself a CEO, a partner, a wife and now that this title is removed you don't know what to do. For others, loss leaves you emotionally gutted with no sense of direction.

I was 33 when my husband died from advanced adrenal cancer in 2007. I spent over three years interviewing widows about their circumstances for my book,A Widow's Guide to Healing,and often the conversation would shift to a widow telling me that she wants to start a new life for herself and her family, but isn't sure where to begin.

This widow isn't alone in not knowing how to begin a new life post-loss. A few months ago, I was at a dinner party and someone asked about my book. As she began to tell me about her move, new job, and starting over, I thought she was a widow. Actually, she haddivorcedher husband of 20-plus years and felt the loss was similar to a death.

Loss is very painful. Even thinking about it can give a knot in your stomach and a lump in your throat. And yet you do desire to shift your energy, mind, and heart towards a different direction. In other words, what can you do to begin to create the life that you want after your devastating loss?

Here are 10 things you can do. These items are in no particular order of importance. The key is that you begin somewhere — and these items are here to help you create a new path for yourself. Some of these things may not work for you, while other items you may find to be a better fit.

1. Set a goal.Goal setting is important because yourself-esteemlikely took a major hit when your loss occurred. At some level, you thought you were able to control things and then you found you couldn't. Setting a goal and being able to achieve it will help you see that you still have control over some things. Reaching the goal will hopefully help to bring back some of your oldconfidence.

This goal does not have to be work-related. The goal should be small enough that it can be attainable within a reasonable amount of time. For example, if your goal is to exercise more and you have never gotten off the couch, setting a reasonable goal would be to exercise two to three times a week, not running a marathon within four weeks. Do not set yourself up for failure.

2. Seek a mentor.Look for someone who is doing what you desire to have for yourself. It would be ideal if you could actually talk with this person, but if you can't for some reason, carefully study what they have done to be at the level you strive to obtain. For example, if you want to be a yoga teacher, then read the biographies and articles about yoga teachers you admire. You will see what lifestyle habits they adapt and begin to follow their lead. They didn't reach overnight success by taking one teacher training class. It's likely that their lifestyle incorporates multiple things which brought them to a certain level.

3. Become very clear about what you desire.In a time of crisis, which is what loss is, you can feel that you need immediate relief, which can cause you to act erratically or impulsively. If you want stability, then a decision made on a whim may not bring the consequence that you seek, because you are not thinking everything out. If you seek trust, you can't get this from others if you do not trust yourself. Finding clarity after a loss often takes time because the water is very muddy after the upheaval created by the loss. Don't expect to know exactly what you want within days or even weeks of your loss.

4. Observe your thoughts.Begin to monitor this. Don't judge your thoughts, just observe. Do you find yourself perseverating on the loss? Do you find yourself talking about some aspect of the loss in many of your conversations? Are you engaging in criticalself-talk? Our thoughts influence our actions. And many times, we are unaware of what we are thinking until we begin to observe our thoughts. You may be in the habit of negative self-talk and you don't even realize that you engage in this behavior several times a day. You can't change something that you are not aware of, so getting an accurate picture of your thoughts is important.

5. Stop one thing.This may sound very remedial but it can change a lot for you. Pick one bad behavior that you find yourself doing and eliminate it. This can be very small. For example, a widow I talked with said that after her husband died, she would eat fast food every time she dropped her daughter off at gymnastics classes. Her daughter was going twice a week and this meant that this widow was eating fast food twice a week. This meal choice was devastating her blood sugar levels, which was impacting her mood and in turn, she found herself being short with her daughter. This didn't mean that this widow never ate fast food, but making this one change helped on multiple levels.

Ending one behavior will allow space for something new. It will also show you that you do have control over something.

6. Engage in new conversations.Engaging in conversations that you haven't had before doesn't always mean that you are seeking out a complete shift in your life. If you have always loved modern art, but have no intention of becoming an artist, then start going to modern art exhibits. Just being around artists and this environment will bring something positive to your day.

Also, bemindfulthat certain friends are not healthy. Having continuous conversations with a negative tone is not going to spark a new flame. This doesn't mean that all of your friends are not healthy for you. What I am trying to be clear about is that some conversations are not a good fit for you post-loss.

If you are thinking about a newcareer, then start to enter those conversations as well. For example, if you want to become a physical therapist, then begin to talk with other physical therapists. They will naturally bring up certain topics that are relevant to their profession that you may be unaware of if you had not spoken with them.

7. Practicegratitude.Now, this may sound like a snarky platitude that is overused but often in our sorrow we find it difficult to find things that are good. Part of creating a new path means changing the way we see the world, and when we view things through the lens of gratitude, our world is richer. It is difficult to bring about something new when you are not able to see that which is already present in your life.

8. Be open to all that is unknown.With any loss comes enormousfear, and this fear can cause us to restrict our thoughts and behavior. Some people literally shut down and refuse to listen to anyone. Others are not ready to listen to different opinions or views. When you live with a restricted view, it is like breathing with one lung — you are unable to expand your breath properly.

At some point, opening yourself up is necessary to creating a new path. This doesn't mean that you have to quit your job. What I am referring to is that once you allow yourself to be open without seeking an immediate answer, you will be able to see things in a different light.

9. Accept the unresolved.This is very painful because the loss left you amputated and you may never know why it happened. This item is not for the faint of heart and takes tremendous courage. So, I am providing this suggestion because if you are continuously seeking resolution to your loss, you may find yourself deeply disappointed. Some losses will never bring answers. They do not present themselves with a reason. Seeking a reason for your loss can lead to countless tears and more loss.

10. Ask yourself this deep question.If you can only do one thing on this list, then this is one you may want to seriously consider. With every decision and conversation you find yourself in post-loss, ask yourself this, "Is this going to expand my growth or restrict it?"

Growth after loss is very possible if you properly nurture it. I will write more about this is in a forthcomingPsychology Todaypiece. The bottom line is that new growth comes with a fertile environment and making healthy choices post-loss promotes this.

It’s increasingly common for someone to be diagnosed with a condition such as ADHD or autism as an adult. A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers.


Losing a loved one is one of the most distressing and, unfortunately, common experiences people face. Most people experiencing normal grief and bereavement have a period of sorrow, numbness, and even guilt and anger. Gradually these feelings ease, and it's possible to accept loss and move forward.

For some people, feelings of loss are debilitating and don't improve even after time passes. This is known as complicated grief, sometimes called persistent complex bereavement disorder. In complicated grief, painful emotions are so long lasting and severe that you have trouble recovering from the loss and resuming your own life.

Different people follow different paths through the grieving experience. The order and timing of these phases may vary from person to person:

These differences are normal. But if you're unable to move through these stages more than a year after the death of a loved one, you may have complicated grief. If so, seek treatment. It can help you come to terms with your loss and reclaim a sense of acceptance and peace.

During the first few months after a loss, many signs and symptoms of normal grief are the same as those of complicated grief. However, while normal grief symptoms gradually start to fade over time, those of complicated grief linger or get worse. Complicated grief is like being in an ongoing, heightened state of mourning that keeps you from healing.

Signs and symptoms of complicated grief may include:

Complicated grief also may be indicated if you continue to:

Contact your doctor or a mental health professional if you have intense grief and problems functioning that don't improve at least one year after the passing of your loved one.

At times, people with complicated grief may consider suicide. If you're thinking about suicide, talk to someone you trust. If you think you may act on suicidal feelings, call 911 or your local emergency services number right away. Or contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use theLifeline Chat. Services are free and confidential.

It's not known what causes complicated grief. As with many mental health disorders, it may involve your environment, your personality, inherited traits and your body's natural chemical makeup.

Complicated grief occurs more often in females and with older age. Factors that may increase the risk of developing complicated grief include:

Complicated grief can affect you physically, mentally and socially. Without appropriate treatment, complications may include:

It's not clear how to prevent complicated grief. Getting counseling soon after a loss may help, especially for people at increased risk of developing complicated grief. In addition, caregivers providing end-of-life care for a loved one may benefit from counseling and support to help prepare for death and its emotional aftermath.

Transcript:
(00:00) the absence of character will produce hell in a relationship even if it's the greatest chemistry of your life [Music] hi matthew and the gang i recently listened to your podcast from april this year titled how to get over the one who got away and it made me realize i could use your help two years ago i met someone he came into my life out of nowhere and it was easy it wasn't obsessive it wasn't addictive it was just easy and good our connection and chemistry was everything i ever wanted a few weeks later he ghosted me
(00:45) we eventually had a conversation he wasn't ready for a relationship we stayed friends a few months later we tried again after being friends for six months it obviously didn't work again i didn't trust him enough and it was hard we stayed in touch and continued to see each other often taking things very very slow and suddenly i discovered he had a girlfriend it's been a year now i have traveled a lot and went on a solo trip to bali i have dated but nothing compares he once told me he saw himself marrying
(01:26) me but he wasn't ready for anything like that he wasn't ready to be the man i needed we see each other around but we never speak and it feels as if the connection and chemistry is still there and others point it out how do i get over him how do i make myself see that he is not the person for me please help i don't want to waste another year i think this is such a relatable email tell us why you know it wasn't the great love story of you know a five-year-long relationship where you got a dog together and had a house i just mean
(02:07) that it was a lot of the time that's very short-lived and a lot of the time you don't know why it just felt so good and so right that it just ends up getting being the thing that sticks under your skin i also think when someone says it was easy you know there's that feeling of i never normally click like this with somebody it just felt so natural was another word people use felt really natural it just was it just felt right when we were together you know this is the kind of thing people describe a kind of fluidity
(02:40) an organic nature to how it feels to be with this person it doesn't feel forced it doesn't feel strange it doesn't feel awkward it feels so natural when we have that special chemistry it's really easy to build a story and it becomes it becomes extremely hard to let that go even like people have that years after where they go but with them the way it felt when we were together when we were intimate when we went on trips like the way it felt with them it was just so much more than anyone since it becomes a
(03:22) memory played over and over and over again what's up guys i just wanted to let you know as a brief interlude that until august the 7th there is a summer self-care special ticket available for the virtual retreat this is three days of immersive coaching with me in november if you like me as a mentor and you want to be coached by me the summer self-care ticket is the best option for you because this is as cheap as it's going to get between now and the retreat and it's only available until august 7th
(03:51) there are also three great bonuses you'll find out more on the page mhvirtualretreat.com it becomes a bit of a time warp you you get you get lodged in a certain moment in your life in a certain moment in time and you know by definition it can never be that again like it was it was that thing that moment in time and we should qualify it obviously to begin with by saying that connection or no connection chemistry or no chemistry if someone didn't commit to us then they couldn't make good on the promise of being
(04:48) everything we ever wanted it wasn't the connection and chemistry she says is everything she ever wanted but then goes on to say a few weeks later he ghosted me which by the way isn't everything you ever wanted nor is this person not committing nor is this person finding a girlfriend i don't know if it how long that was going on for in the time you were speaking but none of these things are things that are everything you ever wanted is you going away to bali and doing all of these things and giving it space and
(05:30) giving it time and him not coming back to you and saying i've just made a giant mistake which he's not doing that's not everything you ever wanted either so i think the starting point is realizing that this actually is a far far cry from everything you ever wanted it stopped well short of that now that doesn't stop that what's the spanish is it no portuguese words saldarde steve knows it we did we talked about that word in another podcast zelda yeah can you explain saudare to us steve you brought it up matt i think it's some
(06:13) kind of feeling of wistful nostalgia isn't it yeah if it's described as a feeling of longing melancholy or nostalgia that is supposedly characteristic of the portuguese or brazilian temperament but it's a word that to my knowledge doesn't exist in quite the same way in other languages but it's a very it's a very descriptive word in that so it captures something and i don't think that i don't think that the what i'm saying is somewhat logical right that you they didn't commit to you they
(06:56) didn't give you what you wanted so they by definition aren't everything you ever wanted but the logic of that doesn't eliminate the saudade that we may feel that wistful melancholy of what once was that didn't turn into something more and then that can linger but the danger of course is thinking that that is an indication of how important something is instead of just seeing it as one of many many experiences in our lives that may bring up that kind of a feeling you may have that feeling about a time in your life where you were more
(07:49) physically able than you are now you know i you may have a moment of melancholy for a time where you were healthier than you are now or when you had a certain fun moment in your life with friends and life doesn't feel quite as carefree anymore or you don't get to see those friends in that way anymore we're we're capable of that kind of melancholy about many things in our life so i think that part of part of it is putting it on a level with lots of other things in your life that you may have a sense
(08:26) of melancholy for uh that isn't really a wish for your life to go back there but more just uh a moment a moment of nostalgia for something rather than this nostalgia that i'm feeling means that i've really lost something important that to me is the non-sequitur the idea that this relationship must be important because i still have feelings for it and if you lose the sense that the relationship is important which it wasn't because he didn't commit so it was only important for the experience it gave you at the time it
(09:08) was not important in the context of your life as a your future certainly wasn't that um it wasn't that because it didn't become that so it was only important in what it gave you in the present it was not important to your future once you lose that so much of the sting of that melancholy is removed it just you're allowed to just feel it as a sense of melancholy instead of a tremendous sense of loss for a future that that was supposed to happen but didn't i love that yeah and i think it's even okay to have those old memories
(09:48) that are beautiful and painful at the same time it's it's not allowing them to become this this thing that like smothers everything else now that's the danger and also matt the interesting thing about this is that i find so fascinating is the thing that she talked about about him loads of things sounded really wrong from the get-go there in terms of his behavior his ghosting not really being involved in it not saying he wanted marriage all these things she wanted why is it that we somehow put chemistry on such a huge emotional
(10:25) pedestal but behavior we just sweep under the rug what do you think that is about i think that our tendency is to overvalue chemistry and undervalue character in a relationship chemistry is i believe necessary for a romantic relationship but character is going to be the foundation of a long-term relationship what is someone's code of ethics their code for living what do they what rules do they live by in their lives and it's very easy to to overrate chemistry because chemistry produces spikes of emotion it produces you know
(11:30) it has a drug inducing effect on us and so it feels it's the it's the um you know it's like the orgasm of courtship is chemistry but that you can't live in that state and expect that that's going to nourish you because it won't nourish you any more than heroin nourishes a drug addict it's a heightened state we the reason i say we overvalue it is because we look back on situations and we go that situation with that person produced this unbelievably intense feeling and that must mean it's important but
(12:21) if you applied that to heroin it would be a disaster if you said uh you know ecstasy or heroin produced such an exquisite feeling when i did it it must mean that this is a really important thing in my life that i should do every day we would look at that and say that's obviously a terrible conclusion to come to and yet in relationships we give them a special pass we we say no that makes sense that if it felt that if the high was that high it makes sense that this should be a constant in your life and it is it is a non-sequitur it
(13:09) chemistry may be important for a relationship i wouldn't advise a relationship that has an absence of a total absence of chemistry how much chemistry we need whether it needs to be the greatest chemistry we've ever had or not is a different question but the absence of chemistry is obviously a bad thing for a relationship but the absence of character will produce hell in a relationship even if it's the greatest chemistry of your life and what you've picked up on there steve is that there is an enormous
(13:45) overvaluing of chemistry in this email but a massive glossing over of the importance of character i mean none of the things that reveal weakness in character whether it's his indecisiveness whether it's his inability to stop seeing her even though he's aware that he's not giving her what she wants it takes a certain kind of selfishness once you realize you're not giving someone what they've clearly said they want you still keep leading them on that's selfish that's a weakness in character
(14:17) they're having a girlfriend part they're still seeing her and staying in touch and doing that once she's tried to go away and move on and not doing the right thing which is to break contact all of these things suggest weaknesses of character but she's not listed any of them as though they were weaknesses in character she's added no detail no emotion to those things but massive emotion to all of the things that are right and what you begin to see in that the way she's written the email is indicative of the way she's
(14:47) writing the story in her brain and if you write a story like that with that level of spin then it's going to produce a certain conclusion and the conclusion is that this person was something very very special and that i'm going to always struggle to get over them because of how special they were one of the great ways to burst that bubble is to just get real about the ways that they're not perfect i mean he has been put on a pedestal above way too many other people and understanding how imperfect someone is
(15:26) is it's not a way to denigrate them it's a way to level the playing field between them and everybody else here's what i want you to do louise as a just a small exercise firstly actually recall what wasn't good about this person and connect to it the same way you connect to the good in what ways has this situation made you miserable in what ways has this person acted selfishly in either not letting you go or reaching out even though they know that you're hurting or not being caring or thoughtful
(16:13) the ghosting in what ways did this person actually make you sad mad or miserable and i want you to notice in other people that you meet qualities they have that he didn't i'm not saying i don't what i don't want you to do is the moment you meet somebody else or go on a date or whatever and you don't feel chemistry i don't want you to be comparing the chemistry but what i do want you to do is notice when someone shows a character trait that makes you go oh wow there's a there's a an empathy or a kindness or a generosity
(17:02) or a conscientiousness or a selflessness about this person that he didn't have and i want you to really tune into that that doesn't mean that the person in front of you is the right person and you should go for them even though you don't feel chemistry what it means is you're starting to to see that there are other people in the world that actually have extremely important qualities in qualities that forget the two years that you've known this guy over 10 years 20 years 30 years are going to be the
(17:41) cornerstone of the relationship they're going to be the thing that makes it last and then say to yourself what i need is someone with these wonderful qualities and someone with whom i feel chemistry someone with whom i feel that connection the person you may be on a date with that you don't feel chemistry with who has these wonderful qualities isn't right for you but nor is he right for you by having the chemistry but not those qualities your person is still out there but any time you meet someone who has the stuff he
(18:27) lacked remind yourself oh he lacked really important things the person i'm supposed to be with is gonna have those things before you go until august the 7th we have the summer self-care ticket available for the virtual retreat this coming november go over to mhvirtualretreat.com and grab that special ticket while they're still available only until august the 7th [Music]


If You're HEARTBROKEN & Can’t MOVE ON - WATCH THIS | Jay Shetty - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) you telling someone like these are the three things she wants in bed like that's not gonna change your relationship if you aren't compatible if you don't connect if you don't speak the right love languages if you're not empathetic if you're not vulnerable like then that three list of this and seven this to that isn't gonna do anything it's void and and that's where i'm trying to get to with people because i don't want people to use sex as a substitute for that and i don't want
(00:20) people to use sex as an excuse for that and i don't want people to use sex as a cover-up for not having any of that because i know having been in tons of relationships where it was just physical and that's all there was that's the only time it felt good it didn't feel good at any other time i didn't go home with a beautiful feeling in my heart and then when it's only about that that's also when it can be easily replaced right because that's easily changeable right and that's why i think
(00:44) so many people go through and i talk about my videos so much about cheating and loyalty because when it is just physical it becomes so much more easier to just disconnect and talk things happen yeah and now heartbreak yes what's your advice on heartbreak i know you have you have a video up it's like the five things people should do through heartbreak and one of them is like get rid of everything from the past and only focus on the present and the future yeah i like that's hard for people i like getting rid of visual triggers
(01:15) i think the challenge in a lot of our lives is that we're surrounded by the same sounds the same sights and the same people that we were in our past and i see this with anything and i'm sure you felt this when you went deeper into your faith did your circles change 100 right when you went deeper into your faith did what you look at change 100 right so you look at my heart change your heart change because internal anxiety yes because for me when i transformed in my faith it was a transformation of my heart yes not about
(01:44) what i was actually doing or not doing correct and that's what i feel for anyone anyone that i've witnessed and observed go through transformation in their life their environments have changed and so for me a lot of us are making it harder for yourself it's like saying i want to start working out every day but i don't own any trainers right it's like that's not going to work it's like doing the opposite like i want to go on a diet but i'm going to keep chocolate cake in my refrigerator right like it's
(02:10) it's that so you're saying you're enabling i want to get over the past but i'm gonna keep my exes sweater right next to me and i'm gonna keep all these text messages that i can keep reading through again why do people go back and read text messages because from someone that broke their heart because nostalgia and imagination is more powerful right the feeling of nostalgia and this is in studies too like the research by nostalgia is you always think things were better in the past with something
(02:36) like that so you read a message you're like oh but they loved me so much and now all you're doing is reality's here and you've got your own version of reality playing here so you're basically writing your own movie script up here when reality is telling you this and nostalgia is that script that fantasy that's never going to be that fantasy that isn't real so it's you saying i don't want to accept what is and i'm trying to accept what if those people who can't get over that that hump
(03:03) what do you tell them one of the biggest things that you do you really want no no no no no it's a good it's a good conversation i think one of the biggest things i say to people is just like let's kind of break their space that they're in it's almost like that person needs a space change and they they need to get out of that zone and so for me i'm always encouraging people to start doing new things i think it's so powerful when you go and have a new experience when you try something
(03:29) new you join a new class you've never done it before because guess what it's about finding yourself again so you're now learning new things about yourself you're not falling in love with yourself it's about falling in love with you correct and i think that the biggest mistake we make in that time is everyone's telling you oh when's the rebound like are you gonna date this guy when are you gonna start dating again or this girl when are you gonna be out there again and it's almost like well no
(03:50) maybe it's about i go inside this time and spend some time with myself and i think new experiences are a beautiful way of doing that because you only learn new things about yourself when you do new things with yourself right you never like you never do new things with ourselves you always you're always doing the same things with the same people but imagine you started new things on your own and now you have new memories and one of the things i've been talking about a lot with people is forming new memories if you don't make
(04:19) new memories the old ones will always hold you back and that's why we're stuck in the old because we're not making any new ones so the old ones just keep pulling you back so the best way to make new memories is a setup an experience do with a friend that you love and when you go out there it's this technique that's often used for grounding in therapy and everything but i use it for presents and that's how we were trained in it as monks when you go somewhere and you're like i want to take a mental picture of
(04:42) this how many times have you ever said that where you go someone you're like i want to yeah have this in my mind and i want to keep it forever and the iphone camera is not and the camera is not going to do it it's not going to keep it emotionally and i think we're so bad at creating emotional memories that are new so the best way to do it is called 54321 okay so when you're in a space and let's say i want to do it of this i look at five things that i could see so five things that i can see right now so i'm going to
(05:05) say you obviously yeah important part of the memory you're important too yeah i'm doing it with you yeah i'm gonna say the rug okay so i'm going for space okay now look at the ceiling so one two three four i'm gonna say the couch so there are five things that i can see the second thing is four things that you can touch okay so four things i can touch my silky dress my really dry skin you're good at descriptions silky dress dry skin this is good the rough textured raw texture yeah yes and oh my gosh yeah
(05:36) amazing three things that you can hear i can hear the light yes i can hear myself swallow and i can hear your voice perfect and then two things that you can smell i can smell my garlic breath and um i'm having a hard time smelling basically anything because i'm seven months pregnant you can hear how clogged i am yeah but maybe my perfume okay okay and then once all about me yeah no that's good and then one thing you can taste garlic great so so if you did that in an experience then you want to take forever
(06:13) all you have to do to to make a mental picture take a mental picture of everything you do five four three to one five things you can see four things you can touch three things you can hear two things you can smell and one thing you can taste i really like that yeah it's beautiful and this is what i mean by when you're going through a breakup the biggest mistake you make is the old memories hold you back because you don't know how to make new memories and so my advice to everyone is go and make new memories
(06:36) okay so i did tony robbins right and it was enlightening it was fun and the biggest thing that i came away with was i don't live in the present i'm constantly living for the what's next yes here we go you know okay team it's time to hustle yeah and he said what are you grateful for and i mean i could sit there and say i'm grateful for my health i'm grateful for my family i'm great you know like i could list a few things but he said what are you grateful for in your career and it's like i had
(07:02) to really go deep and i think that maybe if i started doing the 5-4-3-2-1 i would be able to go back to experiences that i thought my heart remembered but my mind didn't totally and i am totally implementing 543 and that's exactly what it's so today it's used for a lot of people who struggle with anxiety to bring them back to the moment when we were trained in as monks it was what we did for presents like as ellie what you said right and this is why the biggest mistake we make is when you're having an
(07:34) experience the only sense we activate is the eyes and that's where when you're trying to think of a past memory you go what was it again because you have to close your eyes because that was the only one that was activated whereas what we've done with 5.321 is you've now absorbed this memory through all the five senses which means each one of them is going to give you a different burden i like it yeah wow all right switching gears a little bit i really feel like insecurities breed negativity right
(08:01) and a motto that i like to live by is kill people with kindness what do you think about that yes i love that i agree with you completely this is the beautiful thing that happens when you say thank you to someone who's kind to you it does three things the first thing is you recognize kindness so now you are triggering your mind to start recognizing kindness and you're now recognizing kindness in them the second thing you do is you reinforce kindness in them they realize they're like oh when i'm kind people appreciate
(08:29) it right so i'm going to be more kind so you've now reinforced kindness within them and the third thing is you help them repeat it now that you've shown them that their kindness is reciprocated they're now going to be kind to more people so now you've started this domino effect of kindness just by thanking one person who knew yeah it's so interesting to hear you talk about being a monk and like how you spend half the day working yourself in half for the other day working to give out to others and
(08:55) what is your take on putting yourself first and like is it selfish so with with monk teachings the point is you are taking care of yourself first in order to serve better so it's always like i'm going to put myself first so that i can fill up so that i can serve with more because we want to serve with our best selves right i always say this to people it's like people are like jay should i go to this party should i go out to this event should i call up this person should i do this should i do that and i'm just like well if you're
(09:26) gonna show up there with that energy well you're gonna have to convince yourself to go then guess what that person's gonna feel that right because if you wanna show up and you're gonna start with your best so i feel for me it's not selfish if the intention is i want to give more and serve more that's good it's it's selfish when it's just like oh i'm just going to take care of myself because that's all that matters right where is this like no i'm going to take care of myself because i
(09:48) want to give my best self to the people i love right to the people of the world to the people i care for and so i'm going to keep prioritizing myself so i went down the wrong journey when i first started wanting to serve i used to just think oh yeah i'm going to stay up all night someone needs me to drive halfway across the country i'll do that and i would do things like that and i started to realize i was just people pleasing i wasn't serving i was actually serving my own ego that was the most selfish thing
(10:12) interesting it was the most selfish thing because it was just people pleasing but then i realized actually me saying look you know what i need to get a good night's sleep tonight but i promise you first thing in the morning we're going to talk about this and i'm going to bring my best off to this conversation people started to respect that and value that and gave me that space here are three signs you're struggling with a lack of purpose number one you feel pressured to know what you want to do with your life number two

How does my physical health impact my mood?

What Exercise Does To Your Brain – HINT: It’s Like Cannabis - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EoK_RkRdcs

Transcript:
(00:00) We all know that exercise is good for your body and your brain, but why? In fact, exercise decreases depression and anxiety. How and what kind of exercise does that? That's what I'm talking about today. I'm Dr. Tracey Marks, a Psychiatrist and I make mental health education videos. You've probably heard the term runner's high, which describes a phenomenon where after intense aerobic exercise, like running, you can experience this euphoric feeling and sense of wellbeing.
(00:31) For years, it was hypothesized that this was due to the release of endorphins, which is your body's natural opiate. Well, it turns out the runner's high really isn't that common among runners, but anyone can experience a relaxed feeling after moderately intense exercise, not from endorphins, but from endocannabinoids.
(00:51) Let me explain. You do get endorphin release with exercise, it serves the purpose of lessening pain perception during an after intense activity. But those endorphins don't affect your brain and therefore your mood because they don't make it across the blood brain barrier. Your brain is very selective about what that allows to pass through the gate.
(01:13) Some molecules can pass and then others not. An example of this is with the anti-histamine medications. Histamine is a chemical in your brain that makes you alert in medications that block it, make you sleepy. Histamine in your body from the neck down causes the allergic response of itching, hives, airway constriction.
(01:34) So, below the neck, anti-histamines block this allergic reaction. Some anti-histamines like Benadryl make you sleepy because it crosses the blood brain barrier and affects the histamine receptors in your brain. Anti-histamines that don't make you sleepy, like Zyrtec were manufactured to be able to not make it to the brain.
(01:56) So back to exercise, we now believe that the good feeling you get after exercise is due to the release of endocannabinoids that do cross the blood-brain barrier. Endocannabinoids are substances that your body produces that activate cannabinoid receptors in your body. The two most studied endocannabinoids are AEA and 2-AG.
(02:18) I'll spare you the full names, but the A stands for arachidonic acid. When something is made in the body, it's called an endogenous source. When the source is outside of your body, it's called exogenous. The two most studied exogenous cannabinoids are THC and CBD from the cannabis plant. Cannabis has over a hundred cannabinoids that affect the cannabinoid receptors in your body.
(02:44) But THC and CBD are the two that we know the most about. So you can think of vigorous exercise as making your own strain of cannabis, sort of. Your homemade cannabinoids have a mood lifting and anxiety reducing effect, but it gets better. Regular exercise has a longer effect on improving mood and anxiety because it triggers brain derived neurotropic factor, which causes neurogenesis.
(03:11) Neurogenesis is the growth of new cells and the regeneration of damaged cells. Also, researchers have seen that people who exercise regularly have bigger hippocampuses because of this neurogenesis. In the brain world, you want to have a big hippocampus. A small hippocampus is considered a hallmark of depression.
(03:33) Your hippocampus is located in your temporal lobe and it's associated with memory and learning. It not only controls learning tasks like problem solving, but controls your ability to process emotion and allows you to level up your psychological insight. Researchers also believe with neurogenesis, that there's a downstream effect of increasing dopamine and serotonin, both of which we know improves mood.
(03:58) What kind of exercise can give you this nice big hippocampus? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other sources recommend 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity exercise or 75 minutes a week of vigorous intensity. With moderate intensity, you can talk, but not very easily. And you can't sing because your breathing is too fast to hold notes.
(04:21) So if you're talking, you're huffing. Examples of moderate exercise are brisk walking around three miles per hour, slow biking, dancing, or doubles tennis. So if you're walking your dog or gardening and you can sing or whistle attune, you're not doing it hard enough. With vigorous intensity, you can't talk because you're breathing too hard.
(04:43) Examples of this are running, jogging at around six miles per hour, which would be a 10 minute mile, swimming laps, or some aerobic classes, depending on how hard they have you working. You can divide up these times however you want, but it's best to spread it out over the week, like 30 minutes on a treadmill, five times a week for moderate exercise, or a 15 minute fast bike ride five times a week.
(05:10) Now, I will say any kind of activity is better than no activity. So, a slow walk in your neighborhood still brings you some benefit, but to activate the Endocannabinoid System and increase neurogenesis, you need some aerobic activity. I have a link in the description that will give you more guidelines on physical activity.
(05:30) It's from the Department of Health and Human Services. If you like this video, take a look at this one on how intermittent fasting also changes your brain wiring. Thanks for watching. See you next time.

Transcript:
(00:00) whether it's tears falling down our cheeks or a burst of laughter our emotions of an Evoque a physical response you have probably experienced that wave of nausea before walking into a nerve-racking interview or a jolt of excitement before opening a Christmas present but the quick flashes of emotion that we feel in our bodies in the spur of the moment are only a small part of how emotions impact our physical health you may not realize it but our emotions can affect our decision-making at the moment which can have a knock-on effect
(00:31) on our physical health but just how deeply our mind and body connected how much does one affect the other our bodies respond to our emotional health in many ways let's have a look at what might happen when our mental health is in poor shape when we're feeling worried or sad our bodies pH levels begin fluctuating this can incite a physical response such as constipation stomach ulcers and sometimes insomnia or high blood pressure being constantly unhappy you're stressed can also impact our immune system which
(01:20) is why we seem to get more coughs and colds around exam time or why we take longer to shake off infections when things are busy at work and of course if we're feeling moody or nervous we're more likely to skip physical activities that are good for our body and instead those pesky temptations become harder to ignore so we might reach for the ice-cream or an extra glass of wine and if we're really unhappy we've no idea what to do we may even resort to liquor tobacco or other drugs which is usually
(01:52) a recipe for disaster trying to choke back the tears takes a lot of energy leaving you feeling drained burdened and even achy or saw anxiety causes a constant cloud of unease fear or worry which makes our bodies release a steady flow of adrenaline a chemical normally intended for quick reactions adrenaline generally leaves your drunk unable to relax sweaty or even become frozen unable to take action you might have trouble sleeping even if you're tired and you might even need to use the toilet more frequently anger is another
(02:35) adrenaline releasing emotion that's why when angry your muscles tense and your breathing speeds up without being expressed adrenaline causes long-term tension if it's not released you could end up exploding in a rage or smaller unpredictable outbursts these fits of emotion can put you at a greater risk of a heart attack so make sure to express your anger in a healthy way which can range from writing down your emotions in a journal to hitting a punching bag at the gym experiencing constant anger can also restrict your breathing which makes
(03:11) you prone to respiratory problems other emotions we should take into account a shame and guilt these often result in a feeling of butterflies or weight in the stomach that's not too bad but if we keep it up for long enough it can turn into nausea and going stomach problems it's not all bad news though there are also long-term physical benefits associated with emotional impact too when feeling happy your heart rate and breathing can improve a most important of all it causes the brain to release more endorphins and dopamine our
(03:46) happiness chemicals falling in love not only makes you feel relaxed and content but surprisingly it's also thought to bliss the growth of new brain cells which helps improve our memory while having too much adrenaline in our body can be quite damaging short bursts of it can actually be a good thing a little dose of adrenaline can momentarily heighten the senses improve breathing boost the immune system and nul pain is why some people enjoy see of provoking activities like extreme sports haunted houses or scary movies natural
(04:30) high produced by that quick adrenaline hit not only feels fantastic but it can also leave you with a sense of confidence as we have seen emotions have a big role in our physical health the elements we've talked about can be helpful signals that something isn't quite right with our emotional health if we start listening to our bodies we can start taking action to improve our mental well-being on your next visit to the doctor make sure to talk about your physical symptoms and any feelings or problems you may be experiencing in your
(05:04) life you might not be used to talking about these things but it's important you do so that your doctor can take them into consideration when deciding the best course of action for you a healthy mind for a healthy body we hope you found this video enlightening and fun but we also encourage you to continue exploring this subject there's always more to learn and discover so don't stop here please have a look at the links in the description below for more information








Everything you need to know about how mental health affects physical health, including expert recommendations to help improve your mental and physical wellbeing.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works.

To find out exactly how mental health affects physical health, Live Science asked the experts to explain the science behind this profound link.

Mental health is no longer something we are encouraged to keep quiet about. If the COVID-19pandemichas taught us anything about being stuck indoors, it’s that the mental health implications of isolation can have a knock-on effect on your physical health too.

Maybe you have been living withmental healthissues for as long as you can remember, or perhaps have recently found yourself suffering as a result of the pandemic and struggling to lift your mood. Whether you’ve been affected by financial issues or social media pressure, day-to-day tasks can become insurmountable on the most difficult days. For some people, keeping on top of their physical health during these difficult times can seem impossible.

But boosting your physical health as a way to improve your mental health can be as simple as going out for a brisk walk to break up your day, taking up a new skill like cooking, or even discovering thepower of yoga. Taking time to quiet the mind and practice on the mat can do wonders for conditions such as anxiety and depression, especially when you get those endorphins going.

In this article, Rhian Stephenson, a registered nutritionist, naturopath and founder ofARTAHdiscusses how our mental and physical health is connected, how poor mental health can affect our bodies and provides tips on how to improve your mental health.

Stephenson told Live Science, "Think of your health as a system of interconnected biological networks rather than isolated silos." If you ever have days when you just want to stay in bed and shut yourself away from the world this is when mental health issues can impact your physical health.

A recent survey byThe Conversationfound that, as a result of the pandemic, Americans are eight times more likely to suffer from serious mental distress compared to a few years ago.

Sarie Taylor who is a psychotherapist and coach explained: "It is impossible to separate our mind and our bodies as they are intrinsically linked, they speak to each other and work in harmony.

"This means that if we are overwhelmed, stressed, or overthinking in any way then our mind will alert our bodies to that fact, and the body will do its best to alert us and encourage us to pay attention to what is going on. This can be exhausting for both the mind and the body, and so we will feel that in a physical as well as on a mental level." Taylor added.

If your head isn’t in the right space then it can be a downward spiral from there. And if you do find yourself wanting to shut yourself away from the world, your diet can be impacted, too. You might be totally off your food or have no motivation to cook. Mental health issues such as anxiety or depression can make you feel numb and want to close off from the outside world.

Our bodies and minds are profoundly interconnected, so if you suffer from mental health issues then your body will also feel the impact in more ways than one - and vice versa. As an example, when an athlete suffers from a sports injury, their mental health might be impacted by the inability to play or practice their usual daily routine.

"Our mental health will also affect how we feel in our body in more obvious ways,"  explained Stephenson. "Sleep health, motivation and energy for exercise, response to exercise and appetite can all be positively and negatively impacted by our emotional state. For example, studies have shown that emotional states such as anxiety and depression can increaseinsulin resistance, which over time can lead to not only diabetes but increase the risk for other chronic illnesses that are associated with insulin dysregulation."

Our emotional condition is often mirrored by our immune response. Stephenson continued, "…depressed individuals are more likely to have depressed immune activity. Equally, depression is linked to an increased incidence of certain chronic and long-term illnesses, likediabetes, stroke, and heart attack. On the flip side, practices like gratitude, meditation, and even increasing happiness have a direct effect on the immune system, cortisol and other regulatory hormones."

When we are stressed, it causes inflammation in the body, and so you may find that if you have vulnerable areas or injuries, this may be where you feel it most. Taylor told Live Science "Some of the most obvious beginnings of stress are that we may notice tension in the body in the way we sit and hold ourselves, but this is not set in stone, it will be unique to everyone. Every physical response in the body is telling us something, we just need to listen."

Ever wondered why you hold so much tension in your shoulders, neck, head and lower back, without even setting foot in the gym? This is best described as muscular tension and it occurs because of a reflex reaction to stress taking its toll on your body. According to a study by theAmerican Psychological Association, both tension-type headaches and migraine headaches are associated with chronic muscle tension in the shoulders, neck and head. Musculoskeletal pain in the low back and upper extremities has also been linked to stress, especially stress at work. While massage can get rid ofmuscle knots, and other physical symptoms, it will only offer temporary relief.

"If we are too far ahead of ourselves and worrying about the 'what ifs', the most primal part of the brain, the part that looks out for any warning signs and thoughts, will actually act accordingly as though the danger and threat are currently happening.

This area of the brain also regulates the heart rate and temperature of the body and so on, which is why you could find your heart racing and your temperature changing based on your thoughts alone. As stress and worry cause inflammation in the body, this may, in turn, create pain in vulnerable areas of the body that you may struggle with in general even when you are not stressed. This pain can be a fantastic warning sign that your stress is taking its toll on your body, and that you need to prioritize yourself and your wellbeing." Taylor added.

A study by theMayo Clinicexplains some of the key mental health markers to look out for:

"When it comes to mental health there are a lot of factors within your control that you can modify to improve your mental health," said Stephenson.

If you are struggling with your mental health, always seek medical advice and speak to a qualified professional. If you don't feel able to get professional help, you should always try to talk tosomeoneto let them know you are struggling.

Stress symptoms may be affecting your health, even though you might not know it. You may blame sickness for that annoying headache, your sleeping troubles, feeling unwell or your lack of focus at work. But stress may really be the cause.

Stress symptoms can affect your body, your thoughts and feelings, and your behavior. Knowing common stress symptoms can help you manage them. Stress that's not dealt with can lead to many health problems, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, obesity and diabetes.

If you have stress symptoms, taking steps to manage your stress can have many health benefits. Check out many possible stress management tips. For example:

Aim to find active ways to manage your stress. Idle ways to manage stress that don't get you moving may seem relaxing. But they may make your stress go up over time. Examples are watching television, going on the internet or playing video games.

If you're not sure if stress is the cause, or if you've taken steps to control your stress but you keep having symptoms, see your health care provider. Your health care provider may want to check for other potential causes. Or think about seeing a counselor or therapist, who can help you find the sources of your stress and learn new coping tools. And if you are concerned about harming yourself, call 911 or a suicide hotline.

Also, get emergency help right away if you have chest pain, especially if you also have shortness of breath; jaw, back, shoulder or arm pain; sweating; dizziness; or nausea. These may be warning signs of a heart attack and not simply stress symptoms.

Depression and anxiety symptoms often improve with exercise. Here are some realistic tips to help you get started and stay motivated.

When you have depression or anxiety, exercise often seems like the last thing you want to do. But once you get started and keep going, exercise can make a big difference.

Exercise helps prevent and improve many health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes and arthritis. Research on depression, anxiety and exercise shows that the mental health and physical benefits of exercise also can help mood get better and lessen anxiety.

The links between depression, anxiety and exercise aren't entirely clear. But working out and other forms of physical activity can ease symptoms of depression or anxiety and make you feel better. Exercise also may help keep depression and anxiety from coming back once you're feeling better.

Regular exercise may help ease depression and anxiety by:

Regular exercise has many mental health and emotional benefits too. It can help you:

Some research shows that physical activity such as regular walking — not just formal exercise programs — may help mood improve. Physical activity and exercise are not the same thing, but both are good for your health.

The word "exercise" may make you think of running laps around the gym. But exercise includes a wide range of activities that boost your activity level to help you feel better.

Certainly running, lifting weights, playing basketball and other fitness activities that get your heart pumping can help. But so can physical activity such as gardening, washing your car, walking around the block or doing other less intense activities. Any physical activity that gets you off the couch and moving can boost your mood.

You don't have to do all your exercise or other physical activity at one time. Broaden how you think of exercise. Find ways to add small amounts of physical activity throughout your day. For example, take the stairs instead of the elevator. Park a little farther away from work to fit in a short walk. Or if you live close to your job, consider biking to work.

For most healthy adults, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services exercise guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week. Or get at least 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week. You also can get an equal mix of the two types.

Aim to exercise most days of the week. But even small amounts of physical activity can be helpful. Being active for short periods of time, such as 10 to 15 minutes at a time, throughout the day can add up and have health benefits.

Regular exercise may improve depression or anxiety symptoms enough to make a big difference. That big difference can help kick-start further improvements. The mental health benefits of exercise and physical activity may last only if you stick with them over the long term. That's another good reason to find activities that you enjoy.

Starting and sticking with an exercise routine or regular physical activity can be a challenge. These steps can help:

Check with your doctor or other healthcare professional before starting a new exercise program to make sure it's safe for you. Talk about which activities, how much exercise and what intensity level is OK for you. Your healthcare professional can consider any medicines you take and your health conditions. You also can get helpful advice about getting started and staying on track.

If you exercise regularly but depression or anxiety symptoms still affect your daily living, see your healthcare professional or mental health professional. Exercise and physical activity are great ways to ease symptoms of depression or anxiety, but they don't replace talk therapy, sometimes called psychotherapy, or medicines.
